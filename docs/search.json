    "text": "Course Description\nThis course introduces students to R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. Students will learn how to clean, manipulate, transform, join, and tidy data sets to prepare for statistical modeling. Supervised (e.g., regression) and unsupervised (e.g., clustering) approaches will be applied to understand simple and complex relationships between cognitive and non-cognitive variables (e.g., biology, aging, education, socioeconomic, health, etc.). Students will apply their skills to wrangle, explore, and model relevant data sets for a hands-on project for local scholars, offices, organizations, or industry participants. Data sets and relevant readings will change depending on semester.\nPrerequisite: PSYC109 CM or equivalent; recommended a course in Cognitive Psychology or Cognitive Science; or permission of instructor; not open to students who have completed CSCI 36 or any other introductory course in foundation of data science.\n\nCourse Specific Learning Goals\n\nUnderstand various forms of cognitive functioning, how they are measured, and how those abilities relate with other variables\nLearn how to use R and RStudio to answer real‐word questions with data\nUse the {dplyr} and {tidyr} libraries to clean data prior to statistical analysis\nLearn how to import, clean, manipulate, tidy, and summarize data\nExamine relationships among cognitive and non-cognitive variables by applying statistical methods and models to data\nPractice using statistical probability and inference\nLearn how to examine relationships among variables and apply statistical methods and models to data (e.g., supervised or unsupervised machine‐learning methods)\nVisualize data and/or model parameters\nLearn how to manage local and remote projects and collaborate with others\nPractice scientific writing integrating data with theory\nCreate dynamic and reproducible reports with R Markdown\n\nThe following departmental learning goals will also be met: 1.

    "text": "Overview\nStudents will read materials covering data-set relevant cognitive functions or abilities and tasks or tools used to measure those abilities. They will also will learn about coding in R, data validation and wrangling, and support their current knowledge of statistical probability and inference.\nCoding for Data Science: Students will be introduced to functional programming using R, application of models, and use of popular data-science libraries, (e.g., dplyr, ggplot, stringr, etc.). Students would learn elements of programming (e.g., assignment, functions, function arguments, operators, objects, passing objects, control flow, etc.).\nData Validation and Wrangling: Students will learn how to wrangle raw data, clean, and manipulate data. The course would involve both data wrangling and data cleaning. Students would learn main concepts of data sanitation of messy data, for example, how to clean, recode, de-dup, fix structural errors and typos, standardize data, etc. in service of applying machine-learning models.\nStatistical Probability & Inference: Students may not have much experience with formal statistics so they would learn about probability, error, confidence intervals, and frequentist inference in order to interpret data. They would also have to specify models for machine learning, for example, multiple regression.\nMachine Learning: The goal is to introduce students to supervised and unsupervised machine learning applications in order to understand relationships among variables and for classifying and segmenting. For example, supervised learning (e.g., correlation, regression, multiple regression, and if time support-vector machines for nonlinear classification) would be used for understanding relationships among cognitive variables, non-cognitive variables, and to identify groups. Unsupervised learning (e.g., hierarchical clustering, dimension reduction) would be used to understand to data segmentation.\nProject Management: Projects for academics and industry involve collaboration as well as organization of code and materials. Students will learn about and maintain a project with an organized directory structure both locally and remotely with collaborators using Git and GitHub.\nAcademic Integrity. Although you may find yourself working on assignments with a partner or discussing them with classmates, all assignments should be your one original work. You are not to share materials with other students if that material has the potential of being copied, even if your intention is not to allow a classmate to copy your work. Any signs of academic dishonesty will be submitted to the Academic Standards Committee for review. Although I do not anticipate any events of academic dishonesty, any form of dishonestly of any form will not be tolerated.\nMany students are unclear of the definition of plagiarism and for that reason I have posted some CMC links to information that I believe will clarify the issue. In addition, any work completed for another course, past or present, may not be submitted for a grade for this course. http://registrar.academic.claremontmckenna.edu/acpolicy/default.asp\nCourse Modules. This course will be split into modules, allocating various weeks depending on the scope of the module."

Nevertheless, students are expected to attend class prepared to engage with and practice concepts related to readings and lectures. Prior to class, students should have completed readings (e.g., modules or readings referenced therein) and watched any associated lectures on the material. Class time will involve answering questions raised by students, a mining lecture, and coding activities that will inform the final project (note, concepts build). Homework assignments will also involved engagement with the project data. Class time will be spent engaging in a variety of tasks and activities, including lectures, group-work, applied coding activities, presentations, and discussions."

    "text": "University’s policy on Academic Integrity\nThe faculty and administration of Claremont McKenna College support an environment free from cheating and plagiarism. Each student is responsible for being aware of what constitutes cheating and plagiarism and for avoiding both.\n\nViolations of Academic integrity\nEach student is responsible for understanding and acting in accordance with the College’s policy on Academic Integrity, described below.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nAlthough you may find yourself working on assignments with a partner or discussing them with classmates, all assignments should be your one original work. You are not to share materials with other students if that material has the potential of being copied, even if your intention is not to allow a classmate to copy your work. Any signs of academic dishonesty, even those raised by concerned peers, will be submitted to the Academic Standards Committee for review. Although I do not anticipate any events of academic dishonesty, any form of dishonestly of any form will not be tolerated. Many students are unclear of the definition of plagiarism so I have posted some CMC links to information that I believe will clarify the issue. In addition, any work completed for another course, past or present, may not be submitted for a grade for this course and would be a violation of integrity. http://registrar.academic.claremontmckenna.edu/acpolicy/default.asp\n\nStatement of Reasonable Accommodations\nYour experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Disability & Accessibility Services at CMC, please communicate your approved accommodations to me during the first week of the semester so we can discuss your needs in this course ASAP. You can start this conversation by forwarding me your accommodation letter. If you have not yet established accommodations through Accessibility Services but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability (conditions include but are not limited to: mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health), you are encouraged to contact Assistant Dean for Disability Services & Academic Success, Kari Rood, at AccessibilityServices@cmc.edu to ask questions and/or begin the process. General information and accommodations request information be found at the CMC DOS Accessibility Service’s website. Please note that arrangements must be made with advance notice in order to access the reasonable accommodations. You are able to request accommodations from CMC Accessibility Services at any point in the semester. Be mindful that this process may take some time to complete and accommodations are not retroactive. I would err on the side of caution and make sure your accommodations are sent to me even if you do not believe you need them as some students only learn they may need time after completing assessment. The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act do not make accommodations retroactive. If you are approved for extra testing time for example, you must do so before an electronic assessment is posted in order for it to be integrated into the assessment. Claremont McKenna College values creating inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you are not a CMC student, please connect with the Disability & Accessibility Services Coordinator on your campus regarding a similar process.\n\n\n\nFYI on cheating etc.\nRemember, you are responsible for not cheating or violating CMC’s Academic Integrity Policy. You are responsible for understanding that policy, and for conducting yourself in a manner such that you do not violate the policy.\nThe above link lists many examples of cheating and plagiarism that are not allowed. There are many more specific acts that you should NOT do. Here is an additional list of activities that will be sufficient cause for immediate failure in the course.\n\nDo not take pictures of exam or quiz questions and share them with other students\nDo not give other students answers during an exam or quiz, or any other assignment that is an individual assignment\nDo not copy work from another source and submit it as your own\nDo not copy and paste text from the internet and submit it as your own words\nDo not copy and paste text and slightly alter wording to pass the work off as your own\nDo not hire someone else to do the coursework for you\nDo not copy and paste text into a paraphrasing app, and then submit the output of the paraphrasing app as your own work\nDo not copy random words from the internet that have nothing to do with the assignment and submit them as your own work.\nDo not work on individual assignments with other students, share answers or other material, and then all hand in versions of the same thing that are slightly different.\nDo not plagiarize yourself by submitting work that you have previously completed in another class.\n\n\n\nMandate to report violations\nIf a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation. Students should be aware that faculty may use plagiarism detection software.\nThere is no excuse for cheating. Students who are caught cheating may receive a failing grade for the entire course. All students found to have violated the academic integrity will be sanctioned by the Academic Standards Committee."

    "text": "Overview\nIn order to complete the project, there are different components that can be easily broken up and delegated among team members. During weekly team meetings, team members can discuss accomplishments and progress, and check off tasks. Provided many of you have never taken on such tasks and thought about how to break tasks into smaller bite-sized pieces, a general framework maybe be helpful for you.\n\n\nLarge-Scale Tasks\nSome tasks have to be performed in a sequential order but others can be integrated throughout other tasks. For example, describing the motivation of the project, explaining the data and variables used, describing how you prepared the data, presenting findings, etc. are all part of the Report Drafting process. Components can be, and should be, worked on in piecemeal so that they are all not delayed until the end.\n\nReview the project proposal details in /docs\nReview the CHAMP documents in /docs to understand the structure of the data and identify relevant variables\nSchedule to meet with liaison to discuss project in order to formulate a game plan; ask about variables of interest\nOutline the project plan and develop a timeline (consider how timeline maps onto course topics)\nRead data, clean and prepare data for summaries, visualizations, and models\nMerge data parts from team members\nIntegrate team member sub-goal code files\nFinalize report\n\nReport drafting. This tasks can get integrated within the other tasks. For example, delegating tasks, setting deadlines for rough drafts, etc.). Relevant references in /refs can be disseminated, read, and used to prepare the theoretical and conceptual motivation for the project.\n\n\nSmaller-Scale Tasks: A Suggested Process for working with Cognitive Tasks/Survey Questions\nTeams will be working with the symmetry span task, the go/no-go task, and other demographic and response variables. Some variables (viz., tasks or survey) will need to be parceled out and transformed (pivoted) in order to work with in a manageable way. Other response variables may contain only a single question and may require recoding (e.g., response options to numbers) but would not require transformation in the form of pivoting. When there are multiple response options (data columns) as there are with the cognitive tasks, a recommendation is the break the task into pieces.\nA recommended sub-goal process is described below\nA. Break full data into task/survey data\n\nImport master data file\nSelect variables of interest for that Task/Survey\nWrite out wide &lt;task&gt;_wide.Rds data file containing ids and variables for that task\n\nB. Clean the task/survey data\n\nTransform Data: Pivot wide to long\nWrite out long &lt;task&gt;_long.Rds data file\nClean, create, etc. relevant variables (not aggregated)\n\nC. Aggregate/Summarize task/survey data\n\nWrite out long task_long_clean.Rds data file\nAggregate/Summarize Data: Create participant level relevant data (e.g., average accuracy, average response time, etc.)\nWrite out long &lt;task&gt;_long_agg.Rds data file\n\nD. Prepare aggregated task/survey data for statistical description\n\nIf doing correlation with other variables, sometimes need to transform the data frame. If so:\nPivot long to wide\nWrite out long &lt;task&gt;_wide_agg.Rds data file\n\nE. Produce Data Summaries: Descriptive Statistics\nF. Generate any relevant visualizations * using either data that are aggregated or are not aggregated\nG. Modeling: Test relevant prediction(s)"

Looking at the data frame, you see the ‘identity’ of each case. This term is important to {ggplot}. By identity we mean variables are a numeric value, character, or factor. What you see in the data frame is the identity of the variables. Of course, we can change the identity of a variable in some way by transforming the values to z scores, log values, or each average them together to take their count and then plot any of those data. But those transformations do not represent true identities as they appear in a data set.\nIn order to take the data units in the data frame so that they can be represented as physical units on a plot (e.g., points, bars, lines, etc.), there needs to be some scaling transformation. The plot function needs to understand how many pixels high and wide to create a plot and the plot needs to know the limits of the axes for example. Similarly, the plot function needs to know what shapes to present, how many, etc. By default, the statistical transformation is an ‘identity’ transformation, or one that just takes the values and plots them as their appear in the data (their identity). More on this when we start plotting."

    "text": "Adding Aesthetic Mappings\nIf you wanted your plot geometry (the geom() you add later) to inherit properties of the initialized base layer, you could pass aesthetics to the mapping argument mapping = aes() in the ggplot() function. Notice that the argument that we pass to mapping is another function, aes().\nFor example:\n\nggplot(data = SWIM, \n       mapping = aes()\n       )\n\n\n\n\nBut this still does not present anything you can see. You might have guessed that the reason you do not see anything is because nothing was passed to aes(). Here is where you map data to aesthetics by specifying the variable information and passing them to aes(). Looking at ?aes, we see that aes() maps how properties of the data connect to, or map, onto with the features of the visualization (e.g., axis position, color, size, etc.). The aesthetics are the visual properties of the visualization, so they are essential to map by passing arguments to aes().\nHow many and what variables do pass? Looking at ?aes, you see that x and y are needed.\nBecause we passed data = SWIM in ggplot(), we can reference the variables by their column names without specifying the data frame.\nIf x = Year and y = Time:\n\nggplot(data = SWIM, \n       mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Time)\n       )\n\n\n\n\nOK, now we can see something. Although this is progress, what is visible is rather empty and ugly. We can see that the aesthetic layer now applied to the plot scales the data to present Year along the x-axis with a range from lowest to highest value from that vector. Similarly, the mapping presents Time along the y-axis with a range from lowest to highest value in the vector. Also, the aesthetics include the variable name as a the label for the x and y axes. Of course, you can change these details later in a layer as well. More on that later.\nYou might have been tempted to pass the variable names a quoted strings (e.g., “A” and “B) but if you do that, you’ll get something different.\n\nggplot(data = SWIM, \n       mapping = aes(x = \"Year\", y = \"Time\")\n       )\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to plot the data as they are in the data frame, we would apply the ‘identity’ transformation. Again, by identity, we just need to instruct ggplot() to use the data values in the data frame. If you wanted to plot the means, frequency count, or something else, we would need to tell ggplot() how to transform the data. We are not at that point yet though."

    "section": "Recoding vectors",
    "text": "Recoding vectors\nSometimes elements of vectors are messy and need to be fixed. In general, this process is referred to as recoding. There are various ways to recode in R and there are special libraries dedicated to recoding. Now, we will perform some simple recoding.\nYou can use ifelse() or dplyr::case_when() to test whether the elements of a vector match some condition and if yes (do one thing), otherwise no (do something else). In order to understand how these functions and many others work we need to understand a logical test.\n\nifelse()\ndplyr::case_when()\n\n\nPerforming a logical test\nWe can perform a logical test on all types of objects but this example will focus on vectors, for which all elements will be examined. The logical test will return TRUE or FALSE for each vector element depending on whether the case matches a test condition.\nRather than illustrate this the 1000 element sex vector, we will create a vector of length 5 called temp_sex. In this example, you will also see what happens when you need to clean up and recode the sloppy data. You can see are composed of both upper and lower case letters presumably corresponding to biological sex. Because R is a case-sensitive language, \"M\" and \"m\" represent different objects even though the intent is for them to be the same.\n\ntemp_sex &lt;- c(\"M\", \"m\", \"F\", \"f\", NA)\n\nYou can see that some character elements in the vector are upper- and lowercase m’s and f’s. Let’s see what happens when we perform a logical test of the vector. Remember that by itself = will be assignment (like &lt;-). In order to determine whether an object or elements of an object is equal to something, we use ==.\nFor example, temp_sex == \"M\":\n\ntemp_sex == \"M\"\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE    NA\n\n\nThe returned vector is of the same length as the vector tested. Each element of the vector was tested and those elements that matched the character \"M\" returns TRUE. The other elements are FALSE, except of the NA, or missing value. Importantly, the logical test does not return FALSE for NAs.\n\n\nRecoding using ifelse()\nLet’s perform the logical test inside ifelse(). The function will test each element and IF it is TRUE (matches the condition) will assign 0, else/otherwise assign 1 in order to recode the letters into numbers. Of course, you may often wish to recode letters into other letters.\n\nifelse(temp_sex == \"M\", 0, 1)\n\n[1]  0  1  1  1 NA\n\n\nWe can see that all of the TRUEs are 0 and all else except for NA are 0. You can see that only the \"M\" was recoded to 0 and all other elements that were not NA were recoded as 1. Clearly, this is not correct. We can use multiple ifelse() functions but the solution won’t be offered here because it’s just really messy. Instead of focusing on bad code, let’s just focus on offering better solutions.\nPerforming the same test on sex but piping the vector to head() will allow for inspection of the first few elements.\n\nifelse(sex == \"M\", 0, 1) |&gt;\n  head()\n\n[1] 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nThe ifelse() approach is fine for two groups. When there are more than two groups, however, re-coding can be confusing with ifelse() because you’ll need to nest an ifelse() inside an ifelse(). The popular {dplyr} library also has a couple functions similar to ifelse(), for example, if_else() and case_when().\n\n\nRecoding using dplyr::case_when()\nThe case_when() function will also perform logical tests but you can easily specify more than one. The help documentation tells us that “This function allows you to vectorise multiple if_else() statements. Each case is evaluated sequentially and the first match for each element determines the corresponding value in the output vector. If no cases match, the .default is used as a final”else” statement.” And later “If none of the cases match and no .default is supplied, NA is used.\nWith case_when(), we will perform a logical test of the elements against the character string \"M\" first. The elements that match \"M\" will evaluate as TRUE and will be recoded as 0. Then the elements of the new recoded vector will be tested again against \"F\". Those that are TRUE will be recoded as 1. Anything else will be assigned NA for missing because they matched neither \"M\" nor \"F\".\nWe wee that only the first element returns TRUE. Other elements are FALSE or NA.\n\ndplyr::case_when(\n  temp_sex == \"M\" ~ 0,\n  temp_sex == \"F\" ~ 1\n  ) \n\n[1]  0 NA  1 NA NA\n\n\nBut note that if the character case is inconsistent, NA’s will replace elements that are \"m\" and \"f\". An easy fix for casing is to convert the vector (without assignment) by passing it to tolower() or toupper() and then perform the logical conversion on the case change elements.\n\ndplyr::case_when(\n  toupper(temp_sex) == \"M\" ~ 0,\n  toupper(temp_sex) == \"F\" ~ 1\n  ) \n\n[1]  0  0  1  1 NA\n\n\nYou can now see that all elements will evaluate to TRUE and are recoded except for the NA in the vector. Keep in mind that strings may be very messy and require careful inspection and cleaning. Sometimes simple case recoding solves your problems.\nNote: There is a much powerful library called {stringr} for wrangling strings. We will use this library to perform other tasks. If you wanted to familiarize yourself with making strings upper or lowercase using that library, use stringr::str_to_lower() and stringr::str_to_upper().\nTo illustrate:\n\nlibrary(stringr)            # load the library first\n\ndplyr::case_when(\n  str_to_upper(temp_sex) == \"M\" ~ 0,\n  str_to_upper(temp_sex) == \"F\" ~ 1\n  ) \n\n[1]  0  0  1  1 NA\n\n\nWhen you have more logical tests to perform, you can specify them on a new line. Using the existing vector, we can illustrate with a silly example.\n\ndplyr::case_when(\n  temp_sex == \"m\" ~ \"Young Men\",\n  temp_sex == \"M\" ~ \"Old Men\",\n  temp_sex == \"f\" ~ \"Young Women\",\n  temp_sex == \"F\" ~ \"Old Women\",\n  ) \n\n[1] \"Old Men\"     \"Young Men\"   \"Old Women\"   \"Young Women\" NA           \n\n\nWe have not recoded the vector to have clear names for 4 groups, plus and NAs. Of course, you have not changed temp_sex unless you assign the returned vector to a name.\n\ntemp_sex\n\n[1] \"M\" \"m\" \"F\" \"f\" NA \n\n\nAssign to temp_sex to overwrite:\n\ntemp_sex &lt;- dplyr::case_when(\n  temp_sex == \"m\" ~ \"Young Men\",\n  temp_sex == \"M\" ~ \"Old Men\",\n  temp_sex == \"f\" ~ \"Young Women\",\n  temp_sex == \"F\" ~ \"Old Women\",\n  ) \n\n\ntemp_sex\n\n[1] \"Old Men\"     \"Young Men\"   \"Old Women\"   \"Young Women\" NA"

    "text": "Making Local File Changes, Committing, and Pushing to GitHub\n\nMaking a local change\n\nCreate a .R script and name it something like yourname.R. Where should you save it? You guessed it: /r.\n\nChecking the status of local file changes\n\nCheck for the local changes you have made at the Terminal by typing git status and press return/enter\n\n$ git status\n\nIf you made changes, Git will tell you what those changes are. For example, there will be a new file, a deleted file, a modified file, etc.\n\nStaging Changes (Add Changes)\n\nStage a specific change: If you made multiple changes and all you want to do is commit a single change and no others, you can specify the change you want to add. For example, if you want only to add a specific file, like yourname.R, you will use git add &lt;file&gt;... such that &lt;file&gt; refers to the file name.\n\nAt the Terminal prompt, type git add followed by &lt;file&gt; to include in what will be committed)\n$ git add r/yourname.R\n\nStage all change(s): When you make numerous changes, you may wish not to specify each file individually as that could be tedious. In this case, you may wish to stage all of your changes. Assuming everything you are doing is relevant to the project, one of the easiest ways to add changes is to just add all of your file changes. Note, your changes should not be done inside data files (e.g., .csv, .xlsx). Changes should only be done using R code. If not, your project will not be reproducible.\n\nAt the Terminal, you can type git add . which tells Git that you are adding all of those changes to commit them.\n$ git add .\n\n\nCommitting the change(s)\n\nNow that you made a change, you will commit it and assign a useful message to remind your future self and collaborators what you just did.\n\nAt the Terminal, type git commit to commit the changes, add -m to tell git you want a message, and then type the message as a string, \"my message here\" and then press enter/return to commit the changes.\n$ git commit -m \"added my first .R file\"\n\n\nPush the change to the remote repository\n\nWe need to push the changes to the remote GitHub repository for version control and for collaborators to access\n\nAt the Terminal, you will push those changes using git push and press enter/return to push.\n$ git push\n\nIf you navigate to your GitHub account in your web browser, you will see the changes there as soon as they arrive. Congrats!\n\nPractice (Yes, seriously): Changing, Committing, and Pushing Again\n\nYou know that file with your name is not needed for the project. Delete it from the project as you normally would delete a file (no need to use the Terminal) and then add the change, commit the change with message “deleted my silly file”, and push changes.\nIf for some reason, your push did not work, you may need to specify the project branch. Branching is beyond the scope of this course. If team members are working on separate tasks, their code will be compartmentalized so you can use the main branch.\n\nYou can set the branch to the main branch at the Terminal using git branch -M main.\n$ git branch -M main\n\n\nPushing Specific File Changes\n\nYou should not push all of your edits. For example, if you edit a file and save it but it is incomplete (e.g., it contains errors) that will create problems for your team members, you do not want to push them to the repo. If you do, your team member’s code will also break if they are sourcing (e.g., source()) your script file. Similarly, if the data file you write out contains errors, a teammate cannot read that file in successfully. So make sure that what you push is correct and accurate before pushing.\n\nPulling Changes from the Remote\n\nThe opposite of push is pull. When your teammates push their changes (e.g., data cleaning, file creation, etc.) to the repo and your code depends on those files, you will want to make sure their edits are in your local project so that you can use them.\n\nTo pull the changes down to your project, at the Terminal, type git pull.\n$ git pull\n\nYou should find the changes appear in your local project directory."

    "text": "R Markdown: Code Execution\nThis exercise is created with R Markdown code. R Markdown is a version of Markdown, which is a markup language for creating formatted text output using a plain-text. You are likely familiar with the most famous markup language, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which makes websites readable for us all.\nWithin this R Markdown file, the code is written between particular tick marks ``` and curly braces and {r}. These special character combinations simply allow RStudio to know what is R code (e.g., the lowercase r) and what is written text.\nIn RStudio, you can modify the code block/chunk by clicking the gear to make changes. You can specify whether the code shows the output only, shows the code and the output, whether the code is executed but not shown, or whether the code is not run at all. You can also toggle one and off options to display warnings, message, and other details. You can also review other options if you wish. You’ll notice that warnings and messages will make your output ugly so hiding them is often ideal.\nThis exercise serves as a tutorial with the goal of familiarizing you with using R and R Markdown. The output will be a nice HTML file containing your results. Within the code blocks, to execute code you would put your cursor on the line and press the RUN button (see top right) or press CONTROL+ENTER for PC or COMMAND+ENTER for Mac."

Using R in conjunction with the a distributed version control system, like Git, will facilitate that collaboration process. Writing flexible R code that does not hard-code objects will allow your research project to be reproducible, for example, when variables and data change (e.g., new data added, a new year added, etc.). Git long with GitHub will allow you to track your edits (the version control) and share your code with your collaborators or interested scholars.\nSome benefits of using version control:\n\nFacilitates project sharing (once it’s setup, you’ll get there)\nFacilitates collaboration. Others can also report errors or suggest features to your project.\nMakes reverting back to previous states easy. You can easily revert back to a previous version of your code in the event you discover errors or you delete critical details accidentally.\nServes as a memory for edits when memory fails. All changes across different versions of your code or written content is available.\n\nRStudio integrates support for Git but this interface is a little clunky. You can use it but RStudio also allows for communication via the command line Terminal, which will be the preferred method shared here."

Second, you will register your PAT with the Git credential manager used by your computers operating system using gitcreds::gitcreds_set(). Keep in mind that if you use a different computer (e.g., you get a new one), you’ll need to register the PAT on that computer following the same steps described here.\nTo create your personal access token (PAT), type the following at your R console: \nusethis::create_github_token()\nAfter executing the code, you will be taken to your GitHub account (if you remained logged in). Go to the bottom of the page and click generate token. You should add a description for it so that you can understand its use case. For example, describe it based the computer you are using it on, “my computer make and model”. You may also describe it based on a project you are working on, “token-for-project-xyz”. If you do not add a description, you will likely become overwhelmed and/or confused when you have multiple tokens. When you need to regenerate or delete a token that expires, you will not be able to determine what they are for if you do not add a description.\nAfter creating your token, Copy it to your computer’s clipboard and save it someplace safe. Do not share your token with anyone because anyone who has it can access your public or private GitHub repositories.\nWarning: Your PAT will expire after some duration, usually 30 days unless you change it. For this project, I suggest you change the expiration to a date after the semester ends to ensure you don’t have to go through this process again during the semester. Getting a new PAT is not difficult, however. If your PAT will soon expire, GitHub will send you an e-mail alerting you also. You can regenerate a PAT from a link in your e-mail, so make sure your associated e-mail is one you check."

Containers of different types hold different things and so is true in computer programming. A container for holding water may look different from a container for holding books. In computer speak, one type of container can hold numbers, another can hold characters, another can hold a data frame, etc. The container object is holding whatever you have assigned it to hold.\nWe will deal with different types of objects in data science. Without providing too complicated or technical of descriptions, some are described below.\n\nnumeric objects: representing numeric information (e.g., one’s age)\ncharacter objects: representing character information (e.g., one’s name or race)\nvector objects: representing more than one numeric object (e.g., ages of participants)\ndata frame objects: containing vectors of data (e.g., column variables and row instances of data)\nfunction objects: that accept one object and return an other object (e.g., the mean of numeric vector)\n\nThere are other type of objects that you will learn about and encounter but for now, those are the most relevant."

    "text": "A character object: A silly example\nIf objects are like containers holding things, we can use name of the object (e.g., container) and then assign \"things\" to it using &lt;-. In order to create a character object, we would need to place the characters within quotation marks (e.g., single or double, does not matter). The quotes let R know the contents of container are characters (aka strings).\n\"things\"\nWhen dealing with data, you will encounter many character objects as they often represent factor variables (e.g., race, ethnicity, favorite game, etc.) but you will also see lots of objects that are numeric in some form (e.g., age, rating, cognitive performance, etc.).\nSilly Example:\n\n\"something\" assigned to container\ncontainer &lt;- \"something\"\n\n\ncontainer &lt;- \"things\"\n\nAnd to see its contents, use print() to return the objects content:\n\nprint(container)\n\n[1] \"things\"\n\n\nOr just type the name of the object and you will see the returned object is \"things\".\n\ncontainer\n\n[1] \"things\"\n\n\nFor another example, we could also create an object called name, which we could assign a set of characters, like Jim Bob, making the object a character object.\n\nname &lt;- \"Jim Bob\"\n\nTo see what is returned:\n\nname\n\n[1] \"Jim Bob\"\n\n\nWhether you name is or is not Jim Bob, you can see that name contains the characters that represent the name of someone named “Jim Bob”. Although we assigned \"Jim Bob\" to name, we could have assigned it a given name. The assignment process simply stores the assigned information as an object using of whatever name you decided to call it (e.g., name, Name, NAME, xyz, etc.). We will discuss more on these letter casing differences later.\nYou could also assign the character to the object this way.\n\n\"things\" -&gt; container\n\nHowever, we won’t use much of this approach for different reasons. One reason is that doing so does not follow the R Style Guide. The style guide defines a set of guidelines for coding in R. Rather than memorize all of the styling, pay careful attention to the way code appears in the examples provided and try your best to model your code after the examples. For example, don’t do something this container&lt;-\"things\" just so you save space as doing so makes the code more difficult for you and others to read and understand.\nOK, back to Jim Bob. Of course, there are different people other than Jim Bob who exist in the world but when coding, they do not exist unless you create them. So, let’s create an object that holds the name of \"Jim Bob\".\nname &lt;- \"Jim Bob\"\n\nname &lt;- \"Jim Bob\"     # assign string to object named name\n\n\nName &lt;- \"Jim Bob\"     # we could have assigned it a different name, say Name\n\n\nNAME &lt;- \"Jim Bob\"     # or assigned it in all caps\n\nWhenever you reference the object name (or Name), R will return the contents of the object to you, which in this case will be a character or string object containing a single person’s name because that’s how we assigned it.\n\nname               # call object to return contents of \"name\"\n\n[1] \"Jim Bob\"\n\n\nAnd again, we can use print() to do the same thing:\n\nprint(name)\n\n[1] \"Jim Bob\"\n\n\n\nBeing mindful of case sensitivity\nA word of warning is needed here. Although name, Name, and NAME all contain the same four characters, n a m and e all arranged it he same order, the objects are all different. They just happen to hold the same content. The reason for there being three different object is because R is a case-sensitive language, which means that the letter case matters. In some programming languages, the case is ignored.\nTo illustrate, consider an example for which you assign different names to the object.\nname &lt;- \"Jim Bob\"     # create the object\n\n\nName &lt;- \"Bob\"         # then change it\n\n\nNAME &lt;- \"Jim\"         # then change it again\nIn those languages, if you asked what the name object contained, the program would return \"Jim\" because these characters were assigned last, even though they were assigned to an uppercase version, NAME. With R, you will need to be mindful of the letter case. This is by design, perhaps an advantage rather than a disadvantage."

There is something else important about how R treats them that you cannot see on the surface. Both of these objects are also vectors. Vectors are one-dimensional arrays containing n pieces of information. You might also think of a vector so a variable (e.g., IQs of people). Both the name and year vectors contain only one piece of information, however. If you don’t believe me, we can use some functions that will answer this for us.\n\nis.vector() is a function that returns a logical (T or F) about whether the object is a vector\nlength() is a function that returns a non-negative numeric integer representing the number of elements contained\ntypeof() is a function that returns the object’s type\n\nLet’s try them by passing the object name inside the function.\n\nis.vector(name)   # is it a vector?\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n#?length\nlength(name)      # how many elements?\n\n[1] 1\n\ntypeof(name)      # what is it's type?\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nIf name contained more than one object, it would still be a vector having a different length.

    "section": "Tidy Files",
    "text": "Tidy Files\nThere are many sources of data files and data files take many forms and are structured in different ways. They can be tidy or they can be messy. In general, tidiness refers to a data structure. Much of data science involves wrangling data sets to make them tidy. Whether a data set is tidy or messy depends on how the rows and columns are matched up with cases/observations.\nSo what’s is considered tidy?\n\nEach variable is represented as a column\nEach case/observation is represented as a row\nEach value is represented in a row/column cell\n\nIn other words, data that are tidy are generally structured as two-dimensional flat files of data neatly arranged in rows and columns specifically such that columns are variables and rows contain observations. Cell contain the value of an observation for a variable. Whether data are tidy or messy, data files created by software will be saved to disk and will be recognized by a filename extension. Before addressing more about file names and extensions, let’s first get the look and feel of different structures or arrangements of data.\nFor example:\nname age iq\nBill 28  130\nJane 35  145\nSal  55  125\nAlthough we work with importing data files rather than create them, if you wanted to create the data frame for R we can to so easily with different function. We will discuss standard data frames and data frames that are tibbles later, we can create data frames in base R using the data.frame() function. We would name a variable and then assign the observations/cases as elements of a vector using the combine function, c().\n\ndata.frame(\n  name = c(\"Bill\", \"Jane\", \"Sal\"),\n  age  = c(28, 35, 55), \n  iq   = c(130, 145, 125)\n)\n\n  name age  iq\n1 Bill  28 130\n2 Jane  35 145\n3  Sal  55 125\n\n\nSimilarly, using the tribble() function from the {tibble} library, we can also create a special type of data frame known as a tibble. For tibbles, the arrangement of data is similar to how the data would appear in a file – variables as columns and cases as rows.\n\ntibble::tribble(\n  ~name, ~age, ~iq,\n  \"Bill\", 28, 130,\n  \"Jane\", 35, 145,\n  \"Sal\", 55, 125\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  name    age    iq\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill     28   130\n2 Jane     35   145\n3 Sal      55   125\n\n\nNotice that tibbles don’t take vector objects created using c() with which you are familiar by now. Whether created as a standard data frame or a tibble, the structure is the same but this example represents only one structure. Data sets do not always take this structure, so let’s consider formats that are considered wide-format or long-format so that you understand the difference. Later on, we will explore converted data in one format to the other format.\n\nWide-Format Data Files\nThe organization of those variables and observations can change based on the person or system creating them or based on an analytics software’s expectations for working with those values. In many instances, columns of data sets represent variables and the rows represent the cases/observations. SPSS for example, works with data sets organized in wide-format.\nLet’s work through an example of a wide-format data file. Weight could be an interesting property to measure for tracking a weight-loss program or a body-building program. Weight could be measured weekly or monthly (repeated measures). Let’s say you have measured weight for three or more individuals on three different occasions. In wide-format, the cases correspond to rows and the variables as columns but each measurement is treated as a separate variable combination of weight and time.\n\ntibble::tribble(\n  ~name, ~weight_time1, ~weight_time2, ~weight_time3,\n  \"Bill\", 175, 172, 160,\n  \"Jane\", 135, 130, 131,\n  \"Sal\", 160, 158, 150\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  name  weight_time1 weight_time2 weight_time3\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill           175          172          160\n2 Jane           135          130          131\n3 Sal            160          158          150\n\n\nWe see here that all of the variables are not represented by columns. The individuals name is a variable but weight and time are somewhat confounded. The time variable should be a column and the cell for a row/column should represent the weight. What if the same data had a different structure?\n\n\nLong-Format Data Files\nR and R libraries generally prefer with data sets organized in long-format. In long-format, the cases still correspond to rows and the variables as columns. The difference is that the repeated measurements of weight are organize as separate rows. Because weight is measure at different time, each measurement of weight is associated explicitly with a new column variable time.\n\ntibble::tribble(\n  ~name, ~time, ~weight, \n  \"Bill\", 1, 175,\n  \"Bill\", 2, 172, \n  \"Bill\", 3, 160,\n  \"Jane\", 1, 135, \n  \"Jane\", 2, 130, \n  \"Jane\", 3, 131,\n  \"Sal\", 1, 160, \n  \"Sal\", 2, 158, \n  \"Sal\", 3, 150\n  ) \n\n# A tibble: 9 × 3\n  name   time weight\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill      1    175\n2 Bill      2    172\n3 Bill      3    160\n4 Jane      1    135\n5 Jane      2    130\n6 Jane      3    131\n7 Sal       1    160\n8 Sal       2    158\n9 Sal       3    150\n\n\nNote that this format is tidy. Each row represents an observation. For example, the first row corresponds to “Bill” who weighed 175 lbs at time 1. Similarly, each row contains observations for each variable and each cell contains a row/column value.\n\n\nRearranging Data Files\nDepending on the source of data or the requirement by a client or piece of software, you may sometimes need to rearrange data. For example, you may need to change a wide-formatted file to a long-formatted file or vice versa. For such instances, we will use pivoting functions from {tidyr}."

    "section": "Filename Extensions: General",
    "text": "Filename Extensions: General\nA filename extension is the suffix of the filename following the dot/period. For example, .txt is used for text files, .csv for comma-separated values files, .jpg or .png for image files, and .xls or xlsx for MS Excel files among many file types. The extension is used to help understand how the file should be opened (or read) using a program that can understand that file format. To some extent, extensions are arbitrary; you can change the extension of myfile.xlsx to myfile.txt. Changing the extension does not, however, change the format. Thus, extensions are not arbitrary to the extent that you will need a program that reads the file appropriately. The program that tries to read your newly named myfile.txt will assume the file is in a text format because of its new extension and will fail to open the file correctly. Using MS Excel to read the file will open it just fine because Excel understand the saved format.\nSo why does any of this matter? You may have never thought too much about filenames and extensions before. In fact, your computer may not even be set up to display extensions for common file types. Because data scientists deal with files of all different types, knowing these extensions is necessary for reading and writing data files appropriately. If your computer does not show file extensions, I recommend you change your computer settings so that you can see them by following these links for Mac or Windows PC computers.\n\nFilename Extensions for Data Files\nData files are often associated with .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx file extensions. If you have worked with various statistics software, you may be familiar with other formats like .sav for SPSS data files, .dta for Stata data files, or .sas7bdat for SAS data files. Knowing the file format will prove exceptionally helpful when trying to read data files. In fact, libraries like {haven} and more extensively {foreign} are dedicated specifically to reading data files into R that have been saved by data analytics software packages such as SPSS, Stata, SAS, Minitab, etc.\n\nComma-Separated Files, .csv\nEven for tidy data arranged neatly in rows and columns, one must know the structure of the data file in order to read the file and make sense of its contents.\nExample 1:\nAssume the following data were saved as a file with a .txt extension. The extension is not very diagnostic of the data structure.\n134 66 2000\n128 60 1985\nDo the two rows of data in the above example represent a single column corresponding to social security numbers or do they represent three columns corresponding to variables like weight, height, and year of birth? Both could be true.\nExample 2a, as comma-separated:\nWhen column values of data are separated by a comma ',', the file type is referred to as comma-separated values:\n134, 66, 2000\n128, 60, 1985\nAssuming the commas separate the variables, R would read the file and assign variable names to the columns. In this example, R tells you that there are 3 variables, which it automatically names, V1, V2, and V3.\n\n\n   V1 V2   V3\n1 134 66 2000\n2 128 60 1985\n\n\nExample 2b, as comma-separated:\n134 66 2000,\n128 60 1985,\nReading the data and telling R that commas separate the variables, R would read the file as:\n\n\n           V1 V2\n1 134 66 2000 NA\n2 128 60 1985 NA\n\n\nR is telling you that there are 2 variables, which it automatically names, V1 and V2. The first variable contains the numbers and the second variable contains NA values (missing values). Two variables are specified because the comma splits the row into two pieces representing two variable columns.\nJust because there are commas in a data file, this does not require that you read the file that way. By reading the same data but now telling R that spaces separate the variables rather than commas, R would read the same file as:\n\n\n   V1 V2    V3\n1 134 66 2000,\n2 128 60 1985,\n\n\nR now tells you that there are 3 variables but the last variable contains the comma. A comma is likely not relevant and would need to be removed as part of data cleaning.\nExample 3, comma-separated with variable headers:\nSome data files can include variable names (also separated by columns) at the top of the file. These are helpful with reading in the columns. The next example show what the file might look like.\nname, age, iq\nBill, 28, 130\nJane, 35, 145\nSal, 55, 125\nWhen R reads the file, useful variable names are displayed.\n\n\n  name age  iq\n1 Bill  28 130\n2 Jane  35 145\n3  Sal  55 125"

How to get the file path? Use {here}. To show that the file extension is not strictly important, we can name the file \"example3.txt\" even though the file format is comma-separated based on passing a comma for the separator parameter, sep = \",\".\n\nwrite.table(x = DAT3,                                  # data frame object\n            file = here::here(\"data\", \"example3.txt\"), # project path + data + filename\n            sep = \",\"                                  # delimiter\n)\n\nWarning: If you specify name only of the file (e.g., file = \"example3.txt\"), the data frame will be written to a default location because no file path was provided along with the file name. So where is that default location? Well it depends and it’s complicated depending on whether you are writing code inside files that are .R or .Rmd. By default, .Rmd files will assume the directory from which the .Rmd file is saved and opened. An .Rmd file, however, if not a data file; it’s an R Markdown file for the default directory will likely be someplace other than /data.\nIf you are organized, you (a) save your .R and .Rmd files in a code directory (e.g., /r) or a report directory (e.g., /reports), (b) save your data files in a /data directory, and (c) are using an RStudio Project. The TLDR is that the default is a problem. The solution is to specify the file path using file = the full file path, which is easy to do using here::here(), so just make this a habit now and save yourself from future headaches.\n\n\nWriting with write.csv()\nLet’s do the same using write.csv(). Again, check the help documentation, help(write.csv).\nParameters/Arguments:\n\nx: we need an argument for the data frame object to be written\nfile: we need a character string argument naming a file or a connection open for writing (aka the filepath)\nsep: the default is \",\", so we don’t need to supply it\n\nThe data frame is DAT and the file is file name along with the file path Let’s just change the filename extension to \".csv\" so that we don’t overwrite the previous example.\n\nwrite.csv(x = DAT3,\n          file = here::here(\"data\", \"example3.csv\")\n)\n\nNote: If you open this file with an editor on your computer, you will see a new column is added to it by default. This column has no name and each row of the file will contain a number reflecting the row number. Adding row names is the default before for the function. To omit these row numbers when writing your data, add row.names = FALSE. This is a recommendation and I believe good practice if using write.csv().\nExample:\nwrite.csv(x = DAT3,\n          file = here::here(\"data\", \"example3.csv\"),\n          row.names = FALSE\n)\n\n\nWriting with readr::write_csv()\nDespite it’s name, the {readr} library can save data frames too. Interestingly, at least at the time of this writing, {readr} allows you to write files in excel format even though you cannot open them.\nParameters/Arguments:\n\nx: we need an argument for the data frame object to be written\nfile: we need a character string argument naming a file or a connection open for writing (aka the filepath)\nsep: the default is \",\", so we don’t need to supply it\n\nLet’s now save DAT2a.\n\nreadr::write_csv(x = DAT2a,\n                 file = here::here(\"data\", \"example2a_readr.csv\")\n                 )\n\nNote: Unlike write.csv(), readr::write_csv() does not append the row number to a column."

A solution is to compress the files. The base R function saveRDS() will be the go-to here. By default, saveRDS() compresses the file. Compression will matter for larger data files.\nAlso, when you manipulate data frames, you may change variable types, create new variables of a certain type, etc. Writing you data out as a .csv file will not preserve these characteristics.\nBecause we have not yet addressed how to create or modify variable columns in data frames, we won’t actually change the data type of the data frame.

    "text": "Reading .Rds Files\n\nBase R:\n\nreadRDS(file = \"my_filename.Rds\") for modified data frames\n\n\nYou can specify datatypes upon reading if using readr::read_csv() but you have to do this every time you read a file. If datatypes for variables change, you would need to track those changes so that you can return the data frame to its last state. An alternative is saveRDS() saves datatypes, file encoding, and also compresses the file. Thus, saveRDS() and readRDS() will be go to functions.\nParameters/Arguments:\n\nfile: we need a character string argument naming a file or a connection open for writing (aka the filepath)\n\n\nreadRDS(file = here::here(\"data\", \"example3.rds\"))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  name    age    iq\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill     28   130\n2 Jane     35   145\n3 Sal      55   125\n\n\n\nTab-Separated Files, .tsv\nWhen column values of data are separated by a TAB, the file type is referred to as tab-separated values:\nColumns of data are separated by a tab \"\\t\":\nname    age   iq\nBill    28    130\nJane    35    145\nSal   55    125\nLet’s say these files are all simple text files and unlike the previous .csv example are not saved with extension .tsv that would flag the file format. To provide more detail about opening data files, instead assume that the file is saved as a .txt file. Technically speaking, a csv file is also just a raw text file for which the text is separated by commas. In some instances, you will encounter csv files with extensions like .txt, .dat, .raw, etc.\n\nBase R:\n\nread.table(file = \"my_filename.txt\", sep = \"\\t\") is a flexible function requiring setting the separator character argument for sep\nread.tsv(file = \"my_filename.txt\") is the same as above except that sep = \"\\t\" is the default\n\n{readr}:\n\nreadr::read_tsv(file = \"my_filename.txt\")\n\n\nWe likely won’t be dealing with .tsv files, so we won’t work through an example here.\n\n\nReading Excel Data Files, .xlsx\nFirst, we need an .xlsx data file. You can obtain one locally or online from a URL. If you don’t not have one locally, we need to get one.\nWe will first create a character object containing the URL to an .xlsx file online:\n\nurl_file &lt;- \"https://github.com/slicesofdata/fods24/raw/main/data/swim/cms-top-all-time-2023-swim.xlsx\""

We will address several approaches for doing so. Each approach are benefical in different contexts.\n\nSelecting Variables as Unquoted Expressions\nVariables can be passed separately without quotes. We can pass two arguments, one with Murder and the other with Assault, separating each with a comma. Because of some special characteristics of the {dplyr}, we can use variable names without quotes. Let’s also reduce the returned data frame using head() in order to save space.\n\nUSArrests |&gt; \n  select(Murder, Assault) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Variables as Characters/Strings\nYou are most likely familiar with variable names as quoted strings. We can pass two arguments here using the variable names in quotes. This approach is more similar to a procedures use with in base R functions as you cannot pass unquoted expressions in base R.\n\nUSArrests |&gt; \n  select(\"Murder\", \"Assault\") |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Variables as a Character Vector\nWhat if your variables were in a vector, c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\"))?\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\")) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n\n\nThe same will work if you passed a numeric vector c(1, 3).\n\n\nSelecting Using an External Vector Object\nIn many use cases, you will will have a vector of variable names that would will want to pass rather than type individually. This approach also reduces confusion when you have key variables that you want to work with. Create a vector once and then use again and again. If you make any changes, you will only have to make them once, rather than in multiple places.\nFirst, create the vector object:\n\nkeep_vars &lt;- c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\")\n\nSecond, Then pass the vector into the function:\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(keep_vars) \n\nWarning: Using an external vector in selections was deprecated in tidyselect 1.1.0.\nℹ Please use `all_of()` or `any_of()` instead.\n  # Was:\n  data %&gt;% select(keep_vars)\n\n  # Now:\n  data %&gt;% select(all_of(keep_vars))\n\nSee &lt;https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/faq-external-vector.html&gt;.\n\n\n               Murder Assault\nAlabama          13.2     236\nAlaska           10.0     263\nArizona           8.1     294\nArkansas          8.8     190\nCalifornia        9.0     276\nColorado          7.9     204\nConnecticut       3.3     110\nDelaware          5.9     238\nFlorida          15.4     335\nGeorgia          17.4     211\nHawaii            5.3      46\nIdaho             2.6     120\nIllinois         10.4     249\nIndiana           7.2     113\nIowa              2.2      56\nKansas            6.0     115\nKentucky          9.7     109\nLouisiana        15.4     249\nMaine             2.1      83\nMaryland         11.3     300\nMassachusetts     4.4     149\nMichigan         12.1     255\nMinnesota         2.7      72\nMississippi      16.1     259\nMissouri          9.0     178\nMontana           6.0     109\nNebraska          4.3     102\nNevada           12.2     252\nNew Hampshire     2.1      57\nNew Jersey        7.4     159\nNew Mexico       11.4     285\nNew York         11.1     254\nNorth Carolina   13.0     337\nNorth Dakota      0.8      45\nOhio              7.3     120\nOklahoma          6.6     151\nOregon            4.9     159\nPennsylvania      6.3     106\nRhode Island      3.4     174\nSouth Carolina   14.4     279\nSouth Dakota      3.8      86\nTennessee        13.2     188\nTexas            12.7     201\nUtah              3.2     120\nVermont           2.2      48\nVirginia          8.5     156\nWashington        4.0     145\nWest Virginia     5.7      81\nWisconsin         2.6      53\nWyoming           6.8     161\n\n\nHmm. Warning message.\nNote: select(keep_vars) is deprecated as a solution, so if you see this approach someplace, it won’t work properly at this time or in the future. The warning message states that cannot do this without some modifications. What is suggested is all_of(). When your variables are in an external variable, all_of(keep_vars) will tell select() that your variables are all of the variables in the vector. Yes, this is an extra step but worth the flexibility.\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(all_of(keep_vars)) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n\n\nBut this could be problematic if a variable in your vector does not exists. Let’s add some variables that are not in the data frame and then pass that vector.\nkeep_vars_more &lt;- c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\", \"Var_x\", \"Var_y\", \"Var_z\")\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(all_of(keep_vars_more)) |&gt; \n  head()\nYou will see the following error message:\nError in `all_of()`:\n! Can't subset columns that don't exist.\n✖ Columns `Var_x`, `Var_y`, and `Var_z` don't exist.\nTip: Rather than using all_of(), use any_of(). In this instance, any of the variables that exist in the data frame will be selection. Those variables that are not in the data frame will be ignored. With this approach, your code will not break if there something changes.\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(any_of(keep_vars_more)) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Variables Starting with or Ending with Certain Characters\nOne thing about {dplyr}, when you load the library, there are functions from other libraries that are imported along with {dplyr}’s own functions. These important functions are designed to work with each other, so the people who maintain the libraries have packaged them up nicely so you don’t have to load separate libraries.\nMany of the functions are imported from the {tidyselect} library and these functions are what give you additional manipulation ability. Some imported functions are: all_of(), any_of(), contains(), ends_with(), everything(), last_col(), matches(), and starts_with().\nWith functions like starts_with(), contains(), and ends_with(), you can select variables containing character patterns in their names. For example, rather than code out all variables for a memory span task, you might want to grab variables that contain the characters \"span\".\nRather than hard coding variable names (e.g., \"span_time1\", \"span_time2\", c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\")) to pass as an argument to select(), you would use another function to perform the heaving lifting for you (e.g.,starts_with()). In this case, the variable names that starts_with() specific character patterns get passed to select(). This process represents a good example of whe what is referred to as functional programming. This is also a good example of working smarter, not harder. Rather than coding specifically what to pass as an argument to another function, you utilize another function to pass its returned object as an argument to another function.\n\n\nSelecting Variables Using starts_with()\n\nUnderstanding starts_with()\nBut first, we need to understand what starts_with(), actually does. The function name should provide you some insight but for more information, use ?starts_with.\nstarts_with(match, \n            ignore.case = TRUE, \n            vars = NULL\n            )\nParameters/Arguments:\n\nmatch: a character vector\nignore.case: if TRUE, the default, ignores case when matching names. This is most flexible.\nvars: a character vector of variable names. If not supplied, the variables are taken from the current selection context (as established by functions like select() or pivot_longer()).\n\nThe best way to understand the function is to use it (after reading the documentation). Let’s try out starts_with(). Let’s set a required pattern match = some character and because vars = NULL by default, let’s just set vars = some character vector. If you reviewed the documentation or looked at the arguments above, vars is not the second parameter, so you will want to name it in the function call if it takes that second position as seen below. We will first test this function without using it on a data frame.\nWe set match = \"a\" and vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\"). This will look for character \"a\" to match the elements of a character vector c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\").\n\nstarts_with(match = \"a\", \n            vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")\n            )\n\ninteger(0)\n\n\nWhat is returned is integer(0), which is actually speak for “there is no match”. Not very intuitive. Hmm, OK. Let’s try another character.\n\nstarts_with(match = \"b\", \n            vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")\n            )\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nOK, so now an integer is returned (yes, try is.integer() if you don’t believe me).\n\nis.integer(\n  starts_with(\"b\", \n              vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")\n              ))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nAnd even though you only see one value, this object is still a vector. We can check using is.vector().\n\nis.vector(\n  starts_with(\"b\", \n              vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")\n              ))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nImportantly, starts_with() returns a vector of values. What do the values correspond to? The values in the vector refer to the element index/position of a match and the number of the elements in the vector tells refers to the number of matches found. Because the third string element \"Bye\" starts with \"b\", that’s what is returned.\nTry something else:\n\nstarts_with(\"h\", \n            vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")\n            )\n\n[1] 1 2\n\n\nNow the function returns a vector containing 1 and a 2, giving length = 2, representing both the first and the second elements start with “h”.\nImportantly, letter casing is ignored because ignore.case = TRUE by default. Set to FALSE if you want your match to be case sensitive.\n\nstarts_with(\"h\", \n            vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\"), \n            ignore.case = F\n            )\n\ninteger(0)\n\n\nAnd now there are no matches.\n\n\nSelecting Variables from a Data Frame using starts_with()\nYou will typically use starts_with() when working with a data frame and in conjunction with other functions, like select() in order to select variables that start with certain characters. When using starts_with() in the context of select(), the vars argument is essentially passing vars = the names of the columns of the data frame passed to select().\nExample:\nselect(mydataframe,\n       starts_with(match = \"my pattern\",\n                   vars = \"var names of mydataframe\")\n      )\nLet’s provide two use cases:\n\nWithout Piping\n\nYou can pass the data frame as the first argument to select().\n\nselect(USArrests, \n       starts_with(\"m\")\n       ) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder\nAlabama      13.2\nAlaska       10.0\nArizona       8.1\nArkansas      8.8\nCalifornia    9.0\nColorado      7.9\n\n\nNotice that the only column variable that is returned is Murder.\n\nWith Piping\n\nYou can also pipe the data frame into select(), which assumes the first argument is a data frame. This is a process you will see used often by others.\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(starts_with(\"m\")) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder\nAlabama      13.2\nAlaska       10.0\nArizona       8.1\nArkansas      8.8\nCalifornia    9.0\nColorado      7.9\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Variables using ends_with()\nYou can use ends_with() to find matches at the end of strings. This function is useful if you have variables that end based on their measurement type (e.g., “_rt” or “_acc” for reaction times and accuracy, respectively). Having the foresight to create variables is such a way to make accessing them easily later is a good example of working smarter, not harder.\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(ends_with(\"t\")) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Assault\nAlabama        236\nAlaska         263\nArizona        294\nArkansas       190\nCalifornia     276\nColorado       204\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting and Selecting Out Variables By/Between Index\nSo far, we have address selecting variables. There are, however, many approaches for selecting but also selecting out or omitting column variables. In other words, rather than including 14 out of 15 variables, you could simply exclude 1 of the 15 variables to achieve the same result.\nYou can pass multiple arguments for each specification or you can pass a single vector that contains all specifications.\n\nselect(1, 2): select first and second columns\nselect(c(1, 2)): select first and second columns\nselect(-c(1, 2)): select out first and second columns\nselect(1:2): select first through second columns\nselect(c(1:2)): select first through second columns\nselect(-c(1:2)): select out first through second columns\n\nPotential Recommendation: use options utilizing c() to pass a vector because this habit will be more versatile with base R functionality. However, online solutions will likely not take this approach.\nLet’s make a data frame to work with first. We will name the data frame DAT even though this is a terrible name because it lacks diagnosticity.\n\nDAT &lt;- \n  data.frame(\n    Id  = c(100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 100, 105),\n    Sex = c('male', 'female', 'Male', NA, 'man', \"male\", \"neither\"),\n    Age = c(25, 33, 27, 40, 44, 25, 40),\n    Renting = c(\"yes\", NA, \"yes\", NA, \"no\", \"yes\", \"yes\")\n)\n\nSelect columns 1 and 2:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(1, 2) \n\n   Id     Sex\n1 100    male\n2 101  female\n3 102    Male\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man\n6 100    male\n7 105 neither\n\n\nSelect columns 1 and 2 as a vector containing values 1 and 2:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(c(1, 2)) \n\n   Id     Sex\n1 100    male\n2 101  female\n3 102    Male\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man\n6 100    male\n7 105 neither\n\n\nSelect out columns 1 and 2 as a vector containing values 1 and 2:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(-c(1,2)) \n\n  Age Renting\n1  25     yes\n2  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3  27     yes\n4  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5  44      no\n6  25     yes\n7  40     yes\n\n\nSelect from columns 1 to 2 using the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(1:2) \n\n   Id     Sex\n1 100    male\n2 101  female\n3 102    Male\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man\n6 100    male\n7 105 neither\n\n\nSelect from columns 1 through 3 using a vector containing the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(c(1:3)) \n\n   Id     Sex Age\n1 100    male  25\n2 101  female  33\n3 102    Male  27\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40\n5 104     man  44\n6 100    male  25\n7 105 neither  40\n\n\nSelect out columns 1 through 3 using a vector containing the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(-c(1:3))   # select out from here to there\n\n  Renting\n1     yes\n2    &lt;NA&gt;\n3     yes\n4    &lt;NA&gt;\n5      no\n6     yes\n7     yes\n\n\n\n\nSelecting and Selecting Out Variables By or Between Character Name\nThese approaches are similar to those offered earlier except that some involve passing variables by their name (e.g., character names). Whereas the order of the variables in a data frame may move around, the names may be more stable or permanent, at least after you have cleaned up the names. Consequently, passing variables by name may be more foolproof.\nYou don’t have to be familiar with all approaches and you may settle on using one that makes the most sense to you.\n\nselect(\"var1\", \"var2\")\nselect(c(\"var1\", \"var2\"))\nselect(-c(\"var1\", \"var2\"))\nselect(var1:var2))\nselect(c(\"var1\":\"var2))\nselect(-c(\"var1\":\"var2))\n\nRecommendation: use options utilizing c() as this will be more versatile with base R functionality.\nThese function approaches also work but they may lead to some confusion regarding usage of quotes:\n\nselect(var1, var2)\nselect(c(var1, var2))\nselect(-c(var1, var2))\n\nSelect variables Id though Age using the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(Id:Age)                            # select from here to there\n\n   Id     Sex Age\n1 100    male  25\n2 101  female  33\n3 102    Male  27\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40\n5 104     man  44\n6 100    male  25\n7 105 neither  40\n\n\nSelect variables Id though Age passed as strings using the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(\"Id\":\"Age\")                        # select from here to there\n\n   Id     Sex Age\n1 100    male  25\n2 101  female  33\n3 102    Male  27\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40\n5 104     man  44\n6 100    male  25\n7 105 neither  40\n\n\nSelect variables Id though Age as a vector containing the variable names passed as strings and using the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(c(\"Id\":\"Age\"))                     # select from here to there\n\n   Id     Sex Age\n1 100    male  25\n2 101  female  33\n3 102    Male  27\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40\n5 104     man  44\n6 100    male  25\n7 105 neither  40\n\n\nSelect out variables Id though Age as a vector containing the variable names passed as strings and using the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(-c(\"Id\":\"Age\"))                    # select out from here to there\n\n  Renting\n1     yes\n2    &lt;NA&gt;\n3     yes\n4    &lt;NA&gt;\n5      no\n6     yes\n7     yes\n\n\nYou can also use the ! operator to select NOT these variables (therefore, all others)\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(!c(\"Id\":\"Age\"))                    # select out from here to there\n\n  Renting\n1     yes\n2    &lt;NA&gt;\n3     yes\n4    &lt;NA&gt;\n5      no\n6     yes\n7     yes\n\n\n\n\nSelecting and Selecting Out Variables Characters in Their Names\n\nselect(starts_with(\"characters\"))\nselect(ends_with(\"characters\"))\nselect(contains('e'))\n\n\nSelecting using starts_with()\nSelect variables which start with character “i”:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(starts_with('i'))\n\n   Id\n1 100\n2 101\n3 102\n4 103\n5 104\n6 100\n7 105\n\n\nSelect variables which DO NOT start with character “s”:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(-starts_with('s'))\n\n   Id Age Renting\n1 100  25     yes\n2 101  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3 102  27     yes\n4 103  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104  44      no\n6 100  25     yes\n7 105  40     yes\n\n\n\n\nSelecting using ends_with()\nSelect variables which end with character “e”:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(ends_with('e'))\n\n  Age\n1  25\n2  33\n3  27\n4  40\n5  44\n6  25\n7  40\n\n\nSelect variables which end with character “e”:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(-ends_with('e'))\n\n   Id     Sex Renting\n1 100    male     yes\n2 101  female    &lt;NA&gt;\n3 102    Male     yes\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man      no\n6 100    male     yes\n7 105 neither     yes\n\n\n\n\nSelecting using contains()\nSelect variables which contain character “g”:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(contains('g'))\n\n  Age Renting\n1  25     yes\n2  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3  27     yes\n4  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5  44      no\n6  25     yes\n7  40     yes\n\n\nSelect variables which DO NOT contain character “g”:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(-contains('g'))\n\n   Id     Sex\n1 100    male\n2 101  female\n3 102    Male\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man\n6 100    male\n7 105 neither\n\n\n\n\nSelecting using regular expressions\nSometimes you do not want to search for specific character strings. Instead, you might want to look for strings that contain particular character patterns. For example, typing out var1, var2, var3 could be annoying. You might prefer just grabbing variables that match the pattern \"var\".\nWe will use some regular expressions, or regex, to help us. For the regex, you we will need to specify some code for finding patterns. For example, \\\\d{4} will search for patterns with 4 digits, whereas the dot star .* will help with all patterns. In particular, . refers to any character (e.g,. digit, alpha character, or any other special character) and * means zero or more times, so this pattern will search for all files that start with 4 digits followed by anything in the name. A pattern will restrict the search to files containing that exact character string. Some example will be helpful.\n\nSelecting variables of all patterns using \".*\"\nSelect variables containing a regular expression, use matches():\n.* will grab all names because it means any character and any number of times\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(matches(\".*\"))\n\n   Id     Sex Age Renting\n1 100    male  25     yes\n2 101  female  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3 102    Male  27     yes\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man  44      no\n6 100    male  25     yes\n7 105 neither  40     yes\n\n\n\n\nSelecting variables with digits using \"\\\\d\"\n\\\\d will grab all variables containing a digit:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  mutate(var_1    = 1,\n         var_11   = 1,\n         var_3    = 1,\n         var1_var = 1\n         ) |&gt;\n  select(matches(\"\\\\d\"))\n\n  var_1 var_11 var_3 var1_var\n1     1      1     1        1\n2     1      1     1        1\n3     1      1     1        1\n4     1      1     1        1\n5     1      1     1        1\n6     1      1     1        1\n7     1      1     1        1\n\n\n\n\nSelecting variables that start and contain characters \"v.*\\\\d\"\nv.*\\\\d will grab all variables that start with v and then contain any characters which are followed by a digit:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n    mutate(var_1    = 1,\n           var_11   = 1,\n           var_3    = 1,\n           var1_var = 1\n         ) |&gt;\n  select(matches(\"v.*\\\\d\"))\n\n  var_1 var_11 var_3 var1_var\n1     1      1     1        1\n2     1      1     1        1\n3     1      1     1        1\n4     1      1     1        1\n5     1      1     1        1\n6     1      1     1        1\n7     1      1     1        1\n\n\n\n\nSelecting variables that end with a digit using \"\\\\d$\"\n\\\\d$ will grab all variables ending in a digit ($ means end):\n\nDAT |&gt; \n    mutate(var_1    = 1,\n           var_11   = 1,\n           var_3    = 1,\n           var1_var = 1\n           ) |&gt;\n  select(matches(\"\\\\d$\"))\n\n  var_1 var_11 var_3\n1     1      1     1\n2     1      1     1\n3     1      1     1\n4     1      1     1\n5     1      1     1\n6     1      1     1\n7     1      1     1\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting variables by negation\nYou can also negate all regular expression matches if you want to exclude:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n      mutate(var_1    = 1,\n             var_11   = 1,\n             var_3    = 1,\n             var1_var = 1\n             ) |&gt;\n  select(-matches(\"\\\\d$\"))\n\n   Id     Sex Age Renting var1_var\n1 100    male  25     yes        1\n2 101  female  33    &lt;NA&gt;        1\n3 102    Male  27     yes        1\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40    &lt;NA&gt;        1\n5 104     man  44      no        1\n6 100    male  25     yes        1\n7 105 neither  40     yes        1\n\n\nNote: The functions will return lowercase and uppercase variable name matches because the default behavior is ignore.case = TRUE.

Instead, you might want to look for strings that contain particular character patterns. For example, typing out var1, var2, var3 could be annoying. You might prefer just grabbing variables that match the pattern \"var\".\nWe will use some regular expressions, or regex, to help us. For the regex, you we will need to specify some code for finding patterns. For example, \\\\d{4} will search for patterns with 4 digits, whereas the dot star .* will help with all patterns. In particular, . refers to any character (e.g,. digit, alpha character, or any other special character) and * means zero or more times, so this pattern will search for all files that start with 4 digits followed by anything in the name. A pattern will restrict the search to files containing that exact character string. Some example will be helpful.\n\nSelecting variables of all patterns using \".*\"\nSelect variables containing a regular expression, use matches():\n.* will grab all names because it means any character and any number of times\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(matches(\".*\"))\n\n   Id     Sex Age Renting\n1 100    male  25     yes\n2 101  female  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3 102    Male  27     yes\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man  44      no\n6 100    male  25     yes\n7 105 neither  40     yes\n\n\n\n\nSelecting variables with digits using \"\\\\d\"\n\\\\d will grab all variables containing a digit:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  mutate(var_1    = 1,\n         var_11   = 1,\n         var_3    = 1,\n         var1_var = 1\n         ) |&gt;\n  select(matches(\"\\\\d\"))\n\n  var_1 var_11 var_3 var1_var\n1     1      1     1        1\n2     1      1     1        1\n3     1      1     1        1\n4     1      1     1        1\n5     1      1     1        1\n6     1      1     1        1\n7     1      1     1        1\n\n\n\n\nSelecting variables that start and contain characters \"v.*\\\\d\"\nv.*\\\\d will grab all variables that start with v and then contain any characters which are followed by a digit:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n    mutate(var_1    = 1,\n           var_11   = 1,\n           var_3    = 1,\n           var1_var = 1\n         ) |&gt;\n  select(matches(\"v.*\\\\d\"))\n\n  var_1 var_11 var_3 var1_var\n1     1      1     1        1\n2     1      1     1        1\n3     1      1     1        1\n4     1      1     1        1\n5     1      1     1        1\n6     1      1     1        1\n7     1      1     1        1\n\n\n\n\nSelecting variables that end with a digit using \"\\\\d$\"\n\\\\d$ will grab all variables ending in a digit ($ means end):\n\nDAT |&gt; \n    mutate(var_1    = 1,\n           var_11   = 1,\n           var_3    = 1,\n           var1_var = 1\n           ) |&gt;\n  select(matches(\"\\\\d$\"))\n\n  var_1 var_11 var_3\n1     1      1     1\n2     1      1     1\n3     1      1     1\n4     1      1     1\n5     1      1     1\n6     1      1     1\n7     1      1     1\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting variables by negation\nYou can also negate all regular expression matches if you want to exclude:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n      mutate(var_1    = 1,\n             var_11   = 1,\n             var_3    = 1,\n             var1_var = 1\n             ) |&gt;\n  select(-matches(\"\\\\d$\"))\n\n   Id     Sex Age Renting var1_var\n1 100    male  25     yes        1\n2 101  female  33    &lt;NA&gt;        1\n3 102    Male  27     yes        1\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40    &lt;NA&gt;        1\n5 104     man  44      no        1\n6 100    male  25     yes        1\n7 105 neither  40     yes        1\n\n\nNote: The functions will return lowercase and uppercase variable name matches because the default behavior is ignore.case = TRUE.

As discussed previously we can subset in base R to illustrate a point.\nRow row 1, all columns:\n\nDAT[1,]\n\n   Id  Sex Age Renting\n1 100 male  25     yes\n\n\nRow row 6, all columns:\n\nDAT[6,]\n\n   Id  Sex Age Renting\n6 100 male  25     yes\n\n\nNotice that rows 1 and 6 are the same person (e.g., Id) and have exactly the same data for all variables. If we compare the two logically, we will confirm that all is TRUE.\n\nDAT[1,] == DAT[6,]\n\n    Id  Sex  Age Renting\n1 TRUE TRUE TRUE    TRUE\n\n\nYou clearly do not want duplicates of data. So let’s just remove any rows that are identical using distinct()\n\nRemoving Duplicates Across All Variables\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  distinct()       # Remove exact duplicates across all columns\n\n   Id     Sex Age Renting\n1 100    male  25     yes\n2 101  female  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3 102    Male  27     yes\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man  44      no\n6 105 neither  40     yes\n\n\nIf you know each row is unique based on a variable in the data frame, you can also use distinct() to remove duplicates for a specific variable. Make sure that this variable specification is actually one that you would not want duplicates of.\n\n\nRemoving Duplicates Based on a Variable\n\nDAT |&gt;           \n  distinct(Id)     #  Remove duplicates by variable; passes unique values for data frame\n\n   Id\n1 100\n2 101\n3 102\n4 103\n5 104\n6 105\n\n\nBut this function simply returns the unique values in Id. To retain the variables, set .keep_all = T. If you want to remove duplicates and assign the cleaned data frame to an object, you would likely want to keep all of your variables.\n\nDAT |&gt;             \n  distinct(Id, \n           .keep_all = T\n           ) #\n\n   Id     Sex Age Renting\n1 100    male  25     yes\n2 101  female  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3 102    Male  27     yes\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man  44      no\n6 105 neither  40     yes\n\n\nNotice, however, this only removed the last instance or Id == 100. Which row to include is a judgment call. The first, the last, neither, the average? Is there a correct answer?"

The way data are summarized will influence the way the data can be modeled as statistical models typically rely on understanding how predictor variables (independent) can account for variability in outcome variables (dependent). Eliminating variability in data by aggregating will affect the model you can use as well as the statistical inference draw from that statistical model. We will also discuss differences in grouping structure for dplyr::mutate() and dplyr::summarize() that will affect both variable computation and plot creation.\n\n\nBefore Class: First, read to familiarize yourself with the concepts rather than master them.

We can see this by selecting columns from the data frame where() the variable is.numeric().\n\nDAT %&gt;%\n  slice(., 1:5) %&gt;%   # rows 1 through 5\n  mutate(., name = as.numeric(\"0\")) %&gt;%\n  select(., where(~is.numeric(.)))\n\n  name\n1    0\n2    0\n3    0\n4    0\n5    0\n\n\nBut if we try to convert time to numeric this way, you will see that the complex numbers will be converted to NAs, or missing.\n\nas.numeric(DAT$time)\n\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n\n\n  [1] 23.29 23.31 23.49 23.71 23.76 23.77 23.77 23.87 23.93 24.02 51.05 51.24\n [13] 51.41 51.56 51.56 51.88 52.05 52.05 52.14 52.17    NA    NA    NA    NA\n [25]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n [37]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n [49]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n [61] 55.66 55.67 55.91 56.11 56.74 56.83 57.18 57.36 57.47 57.56    NA    NA\n [73]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n [85]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n [97]    NA    NA    NA    NA 54.76 54.92 54.93 55.23 55.74 56.04 56.27 56.42\n[109] 56.47 56.56    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n[121]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA 22.69 22.92\n[133] 22.93 22.95 23.27 23.31 23.33 23.38 23.45 23.47 50.65 50.67 50.92 51.19\n[145] 51.27 51.28 51.29 51.37 51.45 51.56    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n[157]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n[169]    NA    NA 25.94 26.22 26.28 26.57 26.82 26.90 27.14 27.14 27.16 27.17\n[181] 28.33 28.96 29.05 29.06 29.09 29.09 29.24 29.26 29.46 29.55 24.05 24.28\n[193] 24.58 24.59 24.65 24.85 25.05 25.08 25.24 25.34 54.65 54.81 54.91 55.11\n[205] 55.13 55.25 55.27 55.45 55.62 56.21    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n[217]    NA    NA    NA    NA 19.98 20.21 20.22 20.36 20.51 20.65 20.69 20.71\n[229] 20.79 20.82 44.06 44.21 44.73 44.94 45.24 45.31 45.32 45.45 45.50 45.50\n[241]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n[253]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n[265]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n[277]    NA    NA    NA    NA 46.99 47.57 49.32 49.97 50.03 50.29 50.35 50.41\n[289] 50.51 50.59    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n[301] 54.88 55.80 55.92 56.03 56.27 56.35 56.36 56.45 56.49 56.49    NA    NA\n[313]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA 47.45 47.56 47.80 48.74\n[325] 48.91 49.26 49.31 49.34 49.68 49.74    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n[337]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n[349]    NA    NA 19.47 19.63 19.96 20.08 20.10 20.14 20.18 20.22 20.25 20.28\n[361] 43.28 43.69 43.74 44.43 44.57 44.59 44.81 44.81 44.83 44.87    NA    NA\n[373]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA\n[385]    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA    NA 22.32 22.50 22.84 23.00 23.24 23.45\n[397] 23.72 23.74 23.85 23.87 24.73 24.81 24.88 25.10 25.20 25.47 25.55 25.63\n[409] 26.01 26.05 20.60 21.38 21.48 21.58 21.60 21.81 21.83 22.00 22.06 22.07\n[421] 47.01 47.72 48.39 48.50 48.54 48.82 49.00 49.45 49.52 49.60 54.52 55.15\n[433] 55.21 55.47 55.62 56.04 56.13 56.19 56.35 56.48\n\n\nThe problem we have is that the data are not in a clean form. In this data frame, some elements of time are composed of numbers, decimals, and colons (e.g., x.xx, xx:xx.xx, etc.). which all make up elements that would be numbers.\n\n\nConverting variables that are time related using {lubridate}\n{lubridate} is a library for dealing with dates and times. It is also part of the tidyverse} ecosystem.\nThe period_to_seconds() function will convert periods to seconds depending on the period format. We need to pass to it an object that equates to a period of seconds.\nFor time, the format is: hour minute second (e.g., hms). And there is a hms() function to handle this. Let’s see how it works before modifying the data frame. Load the library if it is not loaded.\nWe will pass a single character string and convert it to hms with hms() and then convert that to seconds using period_to_seconds(). Because 60 minutes and 1 hour is the same number of seconds, we should end up with the same values. We can also use ms() to convert the format into minutes and seconds and pass to period_to_seconds(). Following the examples, we will apply to the vector in the data frame.\nlubridate::period_to_seconds(lubridate::ms())\nlubridate::period_to_seconds(lubridate::hms())\nSixty minutes and one hour to hms:\n\nlubridate::hms(\"00:60:00\")\n\n[1] \"60M 0S\"\n\nlubridate::hms(\"01:00:00\")\n\n[1] \"1H 0M 0S\"\n\n\nOne day to hms:\n\nhms(\"24:00:00\")\n\n[1] \"24H 0M 0S\"\n\n\nSixty minutes and one hour to hms to seconds:\n\nlubridate::period_to_seconds(lubridate::hms(\"00:60:00\"))\n\n[1] 3600\n\nlubridate::period_to_seconds(lubridate::hms(\"01:00:00\"))\n\n[1] 3600\n\n\nOK, good. So let’s see if we can convert time. Because hms() is passed into period_to_seconds(), we first need to verify that hms() can handle it.\n\nhms(DAT$time)\n\nWarning in .parse_hms(..., order = \"HMS\", quiet = quiet): Some strings

The default is equivalent to .names = {.col}, which means that the name(s) are inherited from the .cols argument; the names are a stand-in for the name specification. If you wish to have control over the names, you can pass a string that that either appends (e.g.,\"{.col}suffix\") or prepends (e.g.,\"prefix{.col}\") a string to each column name. This string looks odd because it’s a special glue specification that glues together with a string with an object. We will use this concept later when using the {glue} library.\nWhen modifying .names, include a character like \"_\" (e.g.,\"{.col}_suffix\") so that the column names and the appended text are separated, making the name easily legible. If you summarize to create means, a good suggestion is something like (e.g.,\"{.col}_mean\" or (e.g.,\"{.col}_mn\")) so that you know the variable is a mean. If you prefer the function name first, you can use a prefix (e.g.,\"mean_{.col}\").\n\nDAT %&gt;%\n  summarise(., across(.cols = c(\"sec\", \"min\", \"hour\"), \n                      .fns  = ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),\n                      .names = \"{.col}_mean\"\n                      )\n            )\n\n  sec_mean min_mean hour_mean\n1 1309.388 21.82313 0.3637189\n\n\nYou can see how all variables in the summary end in \"_mean\".\nYou can also glue the function and the column names together by passing .names = \"{.col}_{.fn}\".\n\nDAT %&gt;%\n  summarise(., across(.cols = c(\"sec\", \"min\", \"hour\"), \n                      .fns  = ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),\n                      .names = \"{.col}_{.fn}\"\n                      )\n            )\n\n     sec_1    min_1    hour_1\n1 1309.388 21.82313 0.3637189\n\n\nYou you will see there is a number that is appended to the variable name. This is because there is only one function passed to .fns. You can pass more using a special object called a list (see ?list). Unlike vectors, elements of lists need not be the same kind. Elements of lists can combinations of characters, numbers, data frames, functions, etc."

    "text": "Passing multiple functions from a list() in across()\nPassing functions as a list requires a little fancy coding. We will pass two functions as a list so that we can calculate both the mean() and the sd() on the variables passed to across().\nA list is a special object (e.g., container) for which its elements can be different types of objects. Whereas elements of vectors can be only character or only numeric, elements of lists can hold different object. One element can be a numeric vector, another element a data frame, another element a character vector, etc. Many functions used in R will actually return lists for which elements contain different types of objects.\nOK back to two or more functions. If you pass a list() with arguments for the mean and the sd (e.g., list(mean, sd), you can summarize by both. If you want to prevent errors (yes you do) and want to keep the summaries separate (probably so), you can modify .names to pass both the column and the function (e.g., \"{.col}_{.fn}\"). The underscore is not needed here; it only helps with readability of the variables so that you don’t end up with variable names like var1mean but instead var1_mean.\nLet’s pass the summary procedures as a list to include measures of mean and standard deviation for the variables.\n\nDAT %&gt;%\n  summarise(., across(.cols  = c(\"sec\", \"min\", \"hour\"), \n                      .fns   = list(mean, sd),\n                      .names = \"{.col}_{.fn}\")\n            )\n\n     sec_1    sec_2    min_1    min_2    hour_1    hour_2\n1 1309.388 1225.964 21.82313 20.43274 0.3637189 0.3405456\n\n\nWell those are not exactly the names we want but it illustrates how names are created. Because we have two summary functions for each column variable passed to across(), they are enumerated according to the order in the list (e.g., mean then standard deviation).\n\nFixing .names when passing lists to .cols in across()\nEnumeration is not helpful for remembering variable names. There are different ways to do fix this problem, some of which may be better under certain scenarios. You have to determine what approach is best but I’ll lay out some limitations. If you pass only the functions into the list, then when you pass {.fn} to .names, the variable names in the returned data frame will take on a numeric value representing the order/element position of the functions as you entered them in the list. In this coding instance, means would be named with\"_1\" and standard deviation names with \"_2\". This approach, however, leads to confusing variable names because you have to remember which is 1 and which is 2 and of course explain this to anyone with whom you share the data. Let’s take a look.\nA better approach could be to assign the mean and sd functions their own names in the list() function call. By doing so, the name is appended and the new variable is named meaningfully.\nLet’s modify what we pass to .fns by passing a list containing 3 functions (e.g., mean(), sd(), and length()) and give each there name.

One one hand, it does what we expect when all elements can be used to calculate the mean.\n\nmean(DAT$time)\n\n[1] 1309.388\n\n\nOn the other hand, if there is a missing value, it does not computer the mean but instead something else. Let’s add an NA to the vector using c() to see what happens.\n\nmean(c(DAT$time, NA))\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\nUnderstanding NAs when passing lists to .cols in across()\nThe mean() function returns NA rather than a mean. If there is just one NA, mean() returns NA. By design this is actually good.\nLet’s also try sd() for the standard deviation of a vector:\n\nsd(c(DAT$time, NA))\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nThe median of a vector, median():\n\nmedian(c(DAT$time, NA))\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nThe length of a vector, length():\n\nlength(c(DAT$time, NA))\n\n[1] 441\n\n\nWell, that’s interesting. By default length() will return the number of elements of the vector including NAs but by default mean() will not return the mean of a vector with NAs because na.rm = FALSE by default. If you wish to calculate the mean by removing the NAs, pass na.rm = TRUE.\n\nmean(c(DAT$time, NA), na.rm = T)\n\n[1] 1309.388\n\n\nMake note, however, that the length of this vector without NAs is shorter than the length with NAs. We can test this hypothesis on a vector with and without the NA by using na.omit() to omit any of them. Using our vector we added an NA, let’s omit it.\n\nna.omit(c(DAT$time, NA))\n\n  [1] 1409.00 1411.00 1429.00 1451.00 1456.00 1457.00 1457.00 1467.00 1473.00\n [10] 1442.00 3065.00 3084.00 3101.00 3116.00 3116.00 3148.00 3125.00 3125.00\n [19] 3134.00 3137.00  110.30  111.89  112.40  112.55  112.57  112.67  112.80\n [28]  112.83  112.88  112.89  297.37  299.22  299.78  300.06  300.21  300.47\n [37]  301.17  301.99  302.16  302.23  614.33  615.40  622.59  622.84  624.14\n [46]  624.82  626.34  626.89  633.15  636.60 1018.48 1023.21 1026.78 1029.09\n [55] 1029.26 1032.18 1032.46 1033.58 1041.98 1044.49 3366.00 3367.00 3391.00\n [64] 3371.00 3434.00 3443.00 3438.00 3456.00 3467.00 3476.00  119.91  122.10\n [73]  123.73  123.85  123.92  125.10  125.56  125.71  125.76  126.13   61.84\n [82]   63.28   63.51   63.91   64.16   64.19   64.65   64.66   64.77   64.94\n [91]  134.83  135.62  138.99  139.06  139.78  140.01  141.17  141.77  142.34\n[100]  142.83 3316.00 3332.00 3333.00 3323.00 3374.00 3364.00 3387.00 3402.00\n[109] 3407.00 3416.00  121.84  122.58  123.80  124.05  124.42  124.81  126.40\n[118]  127.12  127.33  127.42  120.69  123.59  123.79  124.74  125.41  126.82\n[127]  127.12  127.14  127.81  127.94 1389.00 1412.00 1413.00 1415.00 1407.00\n[136] 1411.00 1413.00 1418.00 1425.00 1427.00 3065.00 3067.00 3092.00 3079.00\n[145] 3087.00 3088.00 3089.00 3097.00 3105.00 3116.00  110.91  110.98  111.39\n[154]  111.41  111.56  111.64  111.95  112.53  112.78  113.04  255.73  267.18\n[163]  270.33  270.77  271.96  272.45  272.57  272.68  274.16  274.27 1594.00\n[172] 1582.00 1588.00 1617.00 1642.00 1650.00 1634.00 1634.00 1636.00 1637.00\n[181] 1713.00 1776.00 1745.00 1746.00 1749.00 1749.00 1764.00 1766.00 1786.00\n[190] 1795.00 1445.00 1468.00 1498.00 1499.00 1505.00 1525.00 1505.00 1508.00\n[199] 1524.00 1534.00 3305.00 3321.00 3331.00 3311.00 3313.00 3325.00 3327.00\n[208] 3345.00 3362.00 3381.00   61.10   62.88   62.89   63.67   64.10   64.16\n[217]   64.24   64.26   64.35   64.43 1238.00 1221.00 1222.00 1236.00 1251.00\n[226] 1265.00 1269.00 1271.00 1279.00 1282.00 2646.00 2661.00 2713.00 2734.00\n[235] 2724.00 2731.00 2732.00 2745.00 2750.00 2750.00   98.35   98.88   99.07\n[244]   99.35   99.63   99.80   99.82  100.30  100.31  100.50  265.67  268.11\n[253]  268.89  269.32  271.64  272.52  272.65  272.94  272.98  274.70  554.11\n[262]  564.43  575.78  576.64  579.27  580.02  581.48  585.72  586.63  587.09\n[271]  917.24  932.19  945.57  947.40  952.94  953.75  956.57  957.89  962.45\n[280]  963.38 2859.00 2877.00 2972.00 3037.00 3003.00 3029.00 3035.00 3041.00\n[289] 3051.00 3059.00  105.05  105.67  106.51  108.84  109.01  109.38  110.32\n[298]  110.43  111.07  111.57 3328.00 3380.00 3392.00 3363.00 3387.00 3395.00\n[307] 3396.00 3405.00 3409.00 3409.00  119.90  121.18  121.45  121.60  121.66\n[316]  121.77  121.78  122.89  123.19  123.23 2865.00 2876.00 2900.00 2954.00\n[325] 2971.00 2966.00 2971.00 2974.00 3008.00 3014.00  103.96  108.70  109.24\n[334]  109.95  109.96  110.34  110.47  110.49  110.51  110.76  106.97  108.74\n[343]  109.74  110.51  110.78  111.11  111.24  111.48  111.82  111.83 1187.00\n[352] 1203.00 1236.00 1208.00 1210.00 1214.00 1218.00 1222.00 1225.00 1228.00\n[361] 2608.00 2649.00 2654.00 2683.00 2697.00 2699.00 2721.00 2721.00 2723.00\n[370] 2727.00   97.98   98.49   99.09   99.19   99.66  100.21  100.22  100.44\n[379]  100.70  100.70  235.61  236.68  236.88  239.02  239.13  239.17  240.63\n[388]  241.14  242.38  242.99 1352.00 1370.00 1404.00 1380.00 1404.00 1425.00\n[397] 1452.00 1454.00 1465.00 1467.00 1513.00 1521.00 1528.00 1510.00 1520.00\n[406] 1547.00 1555.00 1563.00 1561.00 1565.00 1260.00 1298.00 1308.00 1318.00\n[415] 1320.00 1341.00 1343.00 1320.00 1326.00 1327.00 2821.00 2892.00 2919.00\n[424] 2930.00 2934.00 2962.00 2940.00 2985.00 2992.00 3000.00 3292.00 3315.00\n[433] 3321.00 3347.00 3362.00 3364.00 3373.00 3379.00 3395.00 3408.00\nattr(,\"na.action\")\n[1] 441\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"omit\"\n\n\nAnd then get the length when NAs are omitted:\n\nlength(na.omit(c(DAT$time, NA)))\n\n[1] 440\n\n\nThis behavior is important because if you want to obtain the mean of a variable with NAs and the sample size using length(), your sample size will be inaccurate.\nIn order to see these operations on a data frame and in the context of dplyr::summarize(), let’s modify the data frame to include an additional row with some mission values. One simple approach is to use base R to use rbind() to bind a new row to the end of the data frame. In this case, the contents of that new row will be the same as the first row of the data frame (e.g., DAT[1,]). Then the name will be changed and some values will be made missing.\n\nDAT &lt;- rbind(DAT, \n             DAT[1,]\n             )\n\nModify the cells in the data frame using bracket notation from base R. When using brackets, the data frame can be referenced using row and column arguments.\nExamples:\nDAT[]       # all rows and columns\n\nDAT[,]      # all rows and columns (preferred separation with comma)\n\nDAT[1, ]    # row 1, all columns\n\nDAT[,1]     # all rows, column 1\n\nDAT[1:5, \"name\"]    # rows 1 through 5, \"name\" column\n\nDAT[, c(\"name\", \"year\"]    # all rows, \"name\" and \"year\" columns\n\nDAT[15, \"name\"]    # row 15 through 5, \"name\" column\nYou can also obtain the dimensions of a data frame using dim() from base R.\n\ndim(DAT)\n\n[1] 441   8\n\n\ndim() returns a vector with two elements: the number of rows and the number of columns. We can use this to reference the last row in the data frame in order to modify it for this example.\nFollowing from above, examine the last row, change the \"name\" to “Anonymous” and then put NAs in the \"sec\" and \"min\" columns for the same row. Remember, vectors are pure characters or numeric, they cannot contain a mixture of them. Because \"name\" is character vector and \"sec\" and \"min\" are numeric vectors, we need to fix them separately. There are other ways to accomplish this goal but this example illustrates the approach in base R so that you have some exposure.\n\nDAT[dim(DAT)[1], ]                              # the current row contents\n\n                name year   event   team time  sec      min      hour\n441 Jocelyn Crawford 2019 50 FREE Athena 1409 1409 23.48333 0.3913889\n\nDAT[dim(DAT)[1], \"name\"] &lt;- \"Anonymous\"         # make name anonymous\n\nDAT[dim(DAT)[1], c(\"sec\", \"min\")] &lt;- c(NA, NA)  # set these cells to NA\n\nAre NAs across the last row now?\n\nDAT %&gt;% tail()\n\n             name year               event   team time  sec      min      hour\n436 Aaron Lutzker 2019 100 BRST-Relay Spl.

So you can just pass the variable to na.omit() and then wrap it in the metric function of interest. Also, because na.rm = T cannot be used for length(), na.omit() offers consistency across all functions and as a result, I believe, less confusion.\nUnfortunately, accomplishing this task can be rather tricky and requires some new syntax. This requires usage of what’s called a “lambda” technique. You will want to incorporate ~ and .x into your code. The ~ is used to indicate that you are supplying a lambda function and use of .x is to indicate where the variable in across() is used. Using this type of syntax, we can pass functions to the .fns argument that operate across a set of variables. The ?across() documentation calls this “a {purrr}-style lambda” in the arguments section. This approach can be a little bit confusing, so I’m going to show you an example, and then walk through it step by step. You can always create code snippets so you don’t have to rely on memory write complicated code like this.\nAnyway, we will precede the function with ~ and reference the vector using .x. Let’s do this and change the .fns argument slightly.\nHere is a general example:\nname = ~function(na.omit(.x))\nWe will summarize only time and sec because those variables are identical except for the row we added. We will also add dplyr::n() to see what’s going on with that function.\n\nDAT %&gt;%\n  summarise(., across(.cols = c(\"time\", \"sec\"), \n                      .fns  = list(mean = ~mean(na.omit(.x)),\n                                   #sd = ~sd(na.omit(.x)),\n                                   len = ~length(na.omit(.x)),\n                                   n = ~dplyr::n()\n                                   ),\n                      .names = \"{.col}_{.fn}\"\n                      )\n            ) \n\n  time_mean time_len time_n sec_mean sec_len sec_n\n1  1309.614      441    441 1309.388     440   441\n\n\nSo what happened? The means and lengths for time and sec are not the same. Means differ because they are calculated by different values depending on the presence of NAs. But notice that the n’s are the same based on dplyr::n(). How can the means and differ if the n’s are the same?\nSo what’s the point of all of this? Well, you need to be careful not to apply functions and assume they are doing what you believe you are doing. You always need to be smarter than the code you use. Also, there is no single answer for dealing with data. Sometimes one approach will be appropriate and in other instances another approach will be. You as the data scientist need to know that there are different methods so that you an decide where to apply those different methods."

There are different ways to accomplish this goal.\nOne approach that might be the most straight forward to new programmers is to mutate a constant count variable on each row which can be used to sum the counts for different groups.\n\nDAT %&gt;%\n  mutate(., count = 1) %&gt;%         # mutate a new variable where all rows get a 1\n  group_by(., name) %&gt;%            # group by the swimmer name\n  summarise(., count = sum(count)) # sum the count and assign it the name count\n\n# A tibble: 142 × 2\n   name            count\n   &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 A Breazeale         8\n 2 A Roeseler          2\n 3 Aaron Lutzker       6\n 4 Abel Sapirstein     1\n 5 Alec Vercruysse     4\n 6 Alex Mendoza        2\n 7 Alex Poltash        6\n 8 Allyson Yao         3\n 9 Amy Fuller          1\n10 Andrew Cox          4\n# ℹ 132 more rows\n\n\nBy default, the data frame is arranged by the grouping variable (e.g., name). We can change the order of the rows by count using arrange() but this function by default sorts in an ascending manner. If you want a descending sorting, pass count to desc() to arrange the data frame in this way. We can also assign it to an object.\n\nNAME_count &lt;- DAT %&gt;%\n  mutate(., count = 1) %&gt;%\n  group_by(., name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(., count = sum(count)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(., desc(count))\n\n\nNAME_count\n\n# A tibble: 142 × 2\n   name          count\n   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Michele Kee      11\n 2 Augusta Lewis    10\n 3 Matt Williams    10\n 4 Kelly Ngo         9\n 5 A Breazeale       8\n 6 Ava Sealander     8\n 7 Gary Simon        8\n 8 Marco Conati      8\n 9 Nic Tekieli       7\n10 Aaron Lutzker     6\n# ℹ 132 more rows\n\n\nWe can see that the top counts of all time are by Michele Kee for a total of 11.

Hooray for 2022!\n\n\nGrouping by two or more variables:\nWe can also summarize both the teams as well in order to see the top swimmer by team. If you want to summarize more than one variable, pass them both in group_by():\n\nTEAM_NAME_count &lt;- DAT %&gt;%\n  mutate(., count = 1) %&gt;%\n  group_by(., team, name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(., count = sum(count)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(., desc(count))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'team'.

Go Matt!\nTo wrap up this example, sometimes working with separate data frames using filter() can provide more useful or manageable summaries.Perhaps you only want to obtain the mean() or the sum() or the sd() for a single variable. If so, this approach may be easiest.\nIf you are curious, here is a story covering “How CMS teams became the Stags and Athenas”.\n\n\n\nMultiple summary metrics\nSometimes you need more than one summary statistic, for example, the mean() and the sd(). This is a little more complex to code.\nNote: In these code blocks, some arguments may be removed for readability.\n\nGrouping by one variable:\n\nDAT %&gt;%\n  group_by(., event) %&gt;%\n  summarise(., \n            sec_mean = mean(sec, na.rm = T),  \n            sec_median = median(sec, na.rm = T)\n            )\n\n# A tibble: 22 × 3\n   event               sec_mean sec_median\n   &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 100 BACK               3209.      3212.\n 2 100 BREAST             1725.      1696.\n 3 100 BRST-Relay Spl.    1710.      1678.\n 4 100 FLY                3158.      3165 \n 5 100 FLY-Relay Spl.     3135.      3152.\n 6 100 FREE               2917.      2908.\n 7 100 FREE-Relay Spl.    2888.      2896 \n 8 1000 FREE               601.       601.\n 9 1650 FREE               990.       991.\n10 200 BACK                116.       116.\n# ℹ 12 more rows\n\n\nWe can also write the summary functions as a list inside across() along with passing .names = \"{.col}_{.fn}\" if you want the variables named automatically. This approach is more complex but is more flexible.\nWhen you want to summarize across multiple variables using a list of functions, you will want to make sure your .fns argument passes a function using a {purrr}-style lambda (e.g.,~) for that the function is applied across the variables. You will also want to edit .names = \"{.col}_{.fn}\" so that the naming is done automatically rather than hard coding the names.\n\nDAT %&gt;%\n  group_by(., event) %&gt;%\n  summarise(., across(.cols = \"sec\",\n                      .fns  = list(mean = ~mean(na.omit(.x)),\n                                   median = ~median(na.omit(.x))\n                                   ),\n                      .names = \"{.col}_{.fn}\"\n                      )\n            ) \n\n# A tibble: 22 × 3\n   event               sec_mean sec_median\n   &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 100 BACK               3209.      3212.\n 2 100 BREAST             1725.      1696.\n 3 100 BRST-Relay Spl.    1710.      1678.\n 4 100 FLY                3158.      3165 \n 5 100 FLY-Relay Spl.     3135.      3152.\n 6 100 FREE               2917.      2908.\n 7 100 FREE-Relay Spl.    2888.      2896 \n 8 1000 FREE               601.       601.\n 9 1650 FREE               990.       991.\n10 200 BACK                116.       116.\n# ℹ 12 more rows\n\n\n\n\nGrouping by two or more variables:\n\nDAT %&gt;%\n  group_by(., event, team) %&gt;%\n  summarise(., \n            sec_mean = mean(sec, na.rm = T),  \n            sec_median = median(sec, na.rm = T)\n            )\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'event'.

The goal of reading should be to understand and implement code functions as well as support your understanding and help your troubleshooting of problems. This cannot happen if you just read the content without interacting with it, however reading is absolutely essential to being successful during class time. Work through some examples so that you have a good idea of your level of understanding and confidence.\nClass: In class, some functions and concepts will be introduced and we will practice implementing code through exercises."

    "text": "After having several weeks to clean and manipulate project data, brainstorm potential key items to address, identify potential story lines, and create some data summaries, the next step is to present the progress to the class. You goal for the midterm presentation will be to present a clear representation of the research problem to the class (and later liaison) and demonstrate your ability to use R code to a achieve your goals. Compared with the final presentation, the mid-term presentation is designed to showcase your code rather than test models and draw inferences from data.\nYou should describe the problem, outline relevant cognitive tasks, summarize key references and theory, describe the data that will be used to address the problem, and describe your plans to satisfy the question for your liaison. As with all data-science projects, your plan will involve data cleaning. Some that cleaning will have been completed so you can describe what you needed to do in order to get the data in order to tackle subsequent tasks.\nYou will be evaluated on you and your team’s ability to convey the project purpose and goals, your intended plan to meet those goals, and the steps taken to select and prepare data necessary to meet those goals. If you have prepared data in some way, you should share your code and describe the functions used and approach taken to achieve those goals. If you have not prepared all data, you should outline what you need to do in order to prepare and clean it, again my sharing the functions needed and approach. If you have examined some data and prepared any visualizations that could be used to fulfill the project goals, you should share them as well.\nTeams will have slightly different projects guided by the interests of the liaisons, so coding approaches may differ, data preparation may differ, visualizations may differ, and the story told about data will differ. Include code where appropriate to communicate how you achieved your goals.\nAt this stage in the project, the important point is that all team members have been working to understand the problem and its goals. You should have distributed and read the papers outlined by the project liaison in order to and understood some basic findings in the literature, the major theories/explanations for those findings, and have formulated a clear idea about your intended plan to meet the very minimum expectations of the liaison. Regarding data and code, all team members have been challenging themselves to think about data and practice using {dplyr} and other libraries to wrangle and prepare data. In other words, all team members must discuss their role in helping prepare data for the project in some way, whether that be preparing a different task, recoding a different set of variables, or preparing data visualization. In rare events, if the project does not require cleaning and preparation of enough tasks or variables to distribute, team members can work independently to solve the same problem and share the steps taken to achieve the goal."

Without a clear representation of the research problem, variable selection, variable cleaning, and modeling will be unclear. In the end, you should aim to tell a story with data. The story of data will have key characters (e.g., theories, variables, etc.) and supporting characters (e.g., other variables, relationships, etc.). There will be protagonists (e.g., prominent variables and theories) and antagonists (e.g., competing theories and variables) etc. All of these characters have back stories as well (e.g., past research, references, etc.). When you introduce the project, its relevance, you should ensure that you address the key elements so that the liaison has confidence that you have conceptualized and understand the problem accurately. This includes summarizing the research in the readings and clarifying the theories that motivate the question. At the same time, all good stories of science building tension in the audience. Nothing is preordained and if it were, there would be no reason to clean up and examine the data. For example, there may be clear reasons for discovering relationships among variables yet there may be reasons why those relationships may not exist, why they may be accounted for a different variable or set of variables."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The final written report for the project will be delivered to me and to your liaison. I can provide a color-printed copy for you to distribute to the liaison and for their offices. The final report is to be created in R Markdown and knit as a Pdf or Word document. An example starter file can be found here. You are not to write the document in GoogleDocs, or other sharing platforms. The course is designed for you to acquire new skills and build confidence in those skills rather than support other skills. Investing in yourself is what will get you internships, jobs, and leadership roles in labs and lab manager roles in graduate school. Thus, the report is to be put in R Markdown and maintained in the remote repository. Because RStudio does not have grammar check capability, you are free to create your own personal content in a Word Processing software like MS Word before you add the content to R Markdown. However, I advise you change the font in that working file to sans serif font because R Markdown may get confused with certain characters (e.g., serif font apostrophes, etc.) and you may need to fix these issues later. After running your grammar and spelling check, then add the content to the .Rmd file. If you do work in a separate file, you will need to make sure to save this file to the project /report directory and ensure you push that file to the remote repository. Also, make sure you use your initials in the file name so that team members don’t all have the same file names.\nA code lead should take on the responsibility to save the file to /report the team project, add, commit, and push the file to the remote repo on GitHub. When the team works on this report file shared with others on GitHub, I recommend two different approaches:\n\nThe team agrees to request adding changes to the document on a case-by-case basis. The PM oversees the process and controls delegation. A member requests permission from the PM to edit the file through the team Discord channel. The PM approves the request and broadcasts to the team on Discord that Member A will issue a pull request to update the local file with the remote file. After pulling the changes, Member A will (1) update the file locally by adding their content, (2) save the file on their local system, (3) knit an HTML version to ensure there are no errors in knitting and so that others can review your edits without actually opening the .Rmd file, (4) and then exit the file so that it is not active in RStudio. Then, they will (5) add, commit (with a description), and push the changed file to the remote repo on GitHub. Once complete, Member A broadcasts to the team on Discord that they have pushed their changes. The PM asks to verify (just to double check) that Member A has actually exited the file. Once verified, the PM broadcasts that other team members can request from the PM permission to edit the file. Do not edit without permission from the PM.\nThe team agrees upon a contribution schedule (dates, hours) and the PM creates and controls delegation of who will be working on which section and at what time. The PM broadcasts to the team on Discord that Member A will issue a pull request to update the local file with remote file. After pulling the changes, Member A will (1) update the file locally by adding their content, (2) save the file on their local system, (3) knit an HTML version to ensure there are no errors in knitting and so that others can review your edits without actually opening the .Rmd file, (4) and then exit the file so that it is not active in RStudio. Then, they will (5) add, commit (with a description), and push the changed file to the remote repo on GitHub. Once complete, Member A broadcasts to the team on Discord that they have pushed their changes. The PM asks to verify (just to double check) that Member A has closed the file. Then the PM broadcasts that the file can be edited by the next team member according to the schedule agreed upon. Do not edit without permission from the PM.\nThe team decides to work in separate files and create copies of the main .Rmd document that include team member’s initials as a suffix to the filename. The team delegates the sections to be written by specific team members. Each member edits their file, saves it, and ensures they can knit an HTML version of the file. If successful without error, then, they and add, commit, and push changes to the remote so. Team members can view the HTML version without actually opening your file. Although this approach may appear easiest, it presents other problems which is a reason why I recommend it as a third option. A major limitation of this approach is with integrating work. Arranging, rearranging, revising work is more difficult when you are dealing with multiple files. Weaving pieces into one another can be difficult. Team members who need to integrate sections will need to identify where content will be inserted (e.g., between what sentences, etc.). This is a common problem with working with separate files whether by yourself or with others. Also, pieces that are in one file may be overlooked and not incorporated. Problems mentioned here as well as others does not make this approach the most convenient in the long long. Moreover, this approach does not involve as much communication between team members, which all of you know is always essential to successful teamwork. Options #1 and #2 ensure this communication.\n\nNote: Remember that with a version control system like Git, you always have access to all versions of the files pushed to GitHub. You can always revert to a prior version. I can help you with this if you get to this point. Good messages in your commits will be helpful here."

If the column variable Sex is in the data frame and cases are 'male', 'men', 'female', 'women', 'neither', NA, etc., you can specify the column Sex variable and then the row matching condition(s).\n\nFiltering Matches to a Specific Character Value\nThe first argument in dplyr::filter() is a data frame, and the function all dplyr::filter(DAT, Sex == 'female') will filter the data frame named DAT to include rows for which the sex column equals 'female'.

    "text": "The Go/No-Go Task: Understanding Inhibitory Control and Drug Use\nThe Go/No-Go task has been extensively used in research examining the relationship between cognitive functions, particularly inhibitory control, and drug use. Individuals with substance use disorders often exhibit deficits in inhibitory control, and the Go/No-Go task is one of the tools used to assess these deficits. Here are some key findings related to drug use and the Go/No-Go task:\nImpaired Inhibitory Control in Substance Use Disorders: Individuals with substance use disorders, such as those involving alcohol, cocaine, cannabis, and stimulants, often show impaired inhibitory control as measured by the Go/No-Go task. This suggests that difficulties in suppressing automatic responses may contribute to the development and maintenance of addictive behaviors.\nPredictive Value for Substance Use Outcomes: Deficits in inhibitory control, as assessed by the Go/No-Go task, have been found to be predictive of substance use outcomes. Individuals with poorer inhibitory control on the task may be at a higher risk of continued substance use, relapse, or difficulties in maintaining abstinence.\nNeural Correlates: Neuroimaging studies have explored the neural correlates of inhibitory control deficits in substance use. Dysfunction in brain regions associated with inhibitory control, such as the prefrontal cortex, has been observed in individuals with substance use disorders during the performance of the Go/No-Go task.\nTreatment Implications: The Go/No-Go task has also been used to evaluate the effects of interventions and treatments for substance use disorders. Improvements in inhibitory control, as measured by the task, have been associated with successful treatment outcomes.\nPolydrug Use: Research has investigated inhibitory control in individuals with polydrug use, examining how the task performance may vary across different substances. Different substances may have distinct effects on inhibitory control, and the Go/No-Go task helps in understanding these nuances.\nOverall, the Go/No-Go task serves as a valuable tool in studying the cognitive aspects of substance use disorders, providing insights into the relationship between inhibitory control deficits and drug use behaviors. This research contributes to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of addiction and aids in the development of targeted interventions and treatments."

Studies have shown that individuals who smoke cigarettes or use nicotine in other forms may exhibit differences in inhibitory control as measured by the Go/No-Go task.\nInhibitory Control Deficits: Individuals who smoke cigarettes or use nicotine products have been found to demonstrate deficits in inhibitory control. They may have difficulties inhibiting responses to No-Go stimuli compared to non-smokers or individuals who do not use nicotine.\nImpact on Decision-Making: Nicotine use has been associated with alterations in decision-making processes, which are closely related to inhibitory control. The Go/No-Go task assesses the ability to make rapid decisions and inhibit inappropriate responses, and nicotine use may impact performance on this task.\nWithdrawal Effects: Research suggests that acute nicotine withdrawal may further impair inhibitory control. Individuals undergoing nicotine withdrawal may exhibit greater difficulties in inhibiting responses to No-Go stimuli, potentially leading to increased impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors.\nCognitive Processing: Nicotine affects various cognitive processes, including attention, working memory, and inhibitory control. The Go/No-Go task provides insights into the specific cognitive domains affected by nicotine use and withdrawal, helping to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.\nTreatment Response: Studies have investigated the effects of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and other smoking cessation interventions on inhibitory control. Improvements in inhibitory control following smoking cessation may contribute to successful quitting outcomes and relapse prevention."

    "text": "Symmetry Span and Inhibition\nSymmetry Span performance is correlated with inhibition, the ability to suppress or ignore irrelevant information or responses while focusing on relevant stimuli or tasks. This ability is closely related to executive functioning and is an essential component of cognitive control.\nIn the Symmetry Span Task, participants need to inhibit the interference caused by the unrelated items presented between the displays while focusing on the primary task of assessing symmetry. Individuals must resist the temptation to let the interference items disrupt their performance on the symmetry judgment task or interfere with their ability to recall the items presented during the interference phase.\nIndividuals with better inhibition skills are expected to perform better on the Symmetry Span Task because they can more effectively manage competing demands on their attention and resist interference from irrelevant information. Conversely, individuals with weaker inhibition skills may struggle more on the task, as they may have difficulty maintaining focus and effectively managing the interference. Therefore, the Symmetry Span Task serves as a measure of not only working memory capacity but also the ability to inhibit irrelevant information, making it correlated with inhibition as one aspect of executive functioning."

    "text": "Symmetry Span and Go/No-Go\nThe correlation between performance on the Symmetry Span Task and performance on a Go/No-Go task is complex and not direct. Although both tasks involve aspects of executive functioning and cognitive control, they assess somewhat different cognitive processes.\nThe Symmetry Span Task primarily measures working memory capacity and the ability to maintain and manipulate information in memory while managing interference from unrelated items. It also taps into aspects of attention control and inhibition, as participants need to resist interference from irrelevant information during the task.\nThe Go/No-Go task, however, typically measures response inhibition and impulse control. In a Go/No-Go task, participants respond (Go) to one type of stimulus while withholding their response (No-Go) to another type of stimulus. This task primarily assesses the ability to inhibit pre-potent responses and to control impulsivity.\nWhile both tasks involve aspects of inhibition and cognitive control, they assess different aspects of inhibition and may rely on somewhat different neural mechanisms. As a result, the correlation between performance on the Symmetry Span Task and performance on a Go/No-Go task may not be particularly strong or straightforward. However, individuals who perform well on tasks requiring inhibition and cognitive control may also perform well on both tasks due to shared underlying cognitive processes and executive functioning skills."

Like mutate() The expression will require a variable name as well as a value or function.\nAlthough summarize() can create variables like mutate(), it does so by grouping the data in some way. We will cover using summarize() with group_by() to group data but for now, you can see grouping happens automatically, making summarize() a different function than mutate(). The functions serve different purposes. A good rule of thumb for remembering the differences is that mutate() is used to add column variables to a data frame to make it bigger and summarize() is used to reduce the data frame by summarizing the data within it.\nIf we assign a variable name a value, we see that the data frame that is returned is now reduced to a single row.

    "text": "Summarizing with Multiple Functions\nLet’s create the mean and the standard deviation of Score using mean(). Because you will use mean() often, you should understand how it works, so let’s first look at its parameters and default arguments more carefully.\nmean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)\nBy default, the data are not trimmed and NA values are not removed. If NAs exist in your vector, the function will break unless you pass TRUE as the argument to it, na.rm = TRUE. The same is true for sd() for computing the standard deviation.\nLet’s summarize Score using both functions. We see that the data frame has one row and two columns reflecting the variables specified in the function.\n\nDATA |&gt;\n  summarise(mean = mean(Score, na.rm = T),\n            sd   = sd(Score, na.rm = T)\n            )\n\n      mean       sd\n1 76.54545 10.56753\n\n\nYou see the basic operation of summarize(). By default, variables are summarized using functions that aggregate the data across all rows. The resulting summary value is entered as column specified by the named we provided. Of course, however, we may not want to aggregate all of the data as a single group. Rather, we may wish to summarize by grouping data based on subgroups, factors, etc."

    "text": "Data aggregation using group_by()\nLet’s say we want to group the data by School and then summarize. The returned data frame now contains two columns, one for the grouping variable followed by a second for the specification in summarize(). Importantly, the grouping variables will always be organized in the data frame to the left of variables created in the summary.\n\nDATA |&gt;\n  group_by(School) |&gt;\n  summarize(Score = mean(Score))   # get the school level aggregated data\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  School Score\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A       82.5\n2 B       79.5\n3 C       87  \n4 D       62.5\n5 E       66  \n\n\nLet’s say we try to determine mean performance for “all students” if we had the data aggregated as the school level and not the individual level. As a reminder, the mean across all rows in the data frame was rmean(DATA$Score, na.rm = T)`.\nIf we want to summarize the data frame that was summarized, we might assume that we can pipe the data to another add another summarize().\n\nDATA |&gt;\n  group_by(School) |&gt;                # group by school\n  summarize(Score = mean(Score)) |&gt;  # get the school level aggregated data\n  summarize(Score = mean(Score))     # then calculate average across all schools\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  Score\n  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  75.5\n\n\nNote: If you noticed and wonder why the mean value returned here differs from rmean(DATA$Score, na.rm = T)`, make a mental note. We will address that later.\nLet’s say we try to determine average performance for “all students” if we had the data aggregated as the district level and not the individual level.\n\nDATA |&gt;\n  group_by(District) |&gt;                # group by district\n  summarize(Score = mean(Score)) |&gt;    # get the district level aggregated data\n  summarize(Score = mean(Score))       # then calculate average across all districts\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  Score\n  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  77.4\n\n\nSo what’s the average performance for students? Well, that interpretation differs based on how values are treated. At the highest level, all students’ Scores are weighed equally. Each student contributes to the data in the same way. When aggregated by School, each school contributes to the calculation equally, even if the number of bodies per school differs. And finally, when data are aggregated at the District level, all districts are treated equally in the calculation independent on the number of schools in a district. Only with weighting means would you end up with the same average performance.\nMeasures of variability in the data, however, reveal something else. Schools differ in variability and schools within districts vary as well. Depending on the level of aggregation, you may never notice interesting patterns in data that lead to questions to investigate and later policies to change. For example, addressing a school that is left behind others or a district that is left behind others. Aggregation can also lead to inefficient allocations of resources. If one school in a district needs help rather than all schools in the district needing help, the cost may differ substantially.\n\nstd_error &lt;- function(x) { sd(na.omit(x)) / sqrt(length(na.omit(x))) }\n\nUse std_error() in summary:\n\nDATA |&gt;\n  group_by(School, District) |&gt;\n  summarize(Var = var(Score),\n            SD  = sd(Score),\n            SEM = std_error(Score),\n            min = min(Score),\n            max = max(Score)\n  ) |&gt; mutate(range = max - min)\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'School'.

The returned tibble takes on a new structure.\nThe feedback in the console is a little more detailed here.\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'School'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n# Groups:   School [5]\nYou see reference to overriding the grouping using .groups. According to the tidyverse documentation for grouping, this parameter “controls the grouping structure of the output. The historical behaviour of removing the right hand side grouping variable corresponds to .groups = \"drop_last\" without a message or .groups = NULL with a message (the default)”.\nYou have most likely paid little attention to this message. By default summarize() keeps the first grouping variable passed to group_by() in the returned tibble. This is why you see School referenced and not District or both variables. So, do you want your data frame to contain groups or no groups? Stated differently, do you just want that data summarized by your grouping variables and have a simple nxm data frame or do you want something more complex?\nTo see the structure better, let’s first look a the structure of DATA and then more closely at the summarized version.\n\nstr(DATA)\n\n'data.frame':   11 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ Student : chr  \"Jim\" \"Sally\" \"June\" \"Mildred\" ...\n $ Score   : num  80 85 79 80 81 91 89 60 65 67 ...\n $ School  : chr  \"A\" \"A\" \"B\" \"B\" ...\n $ District: chr  \"West\" \"West\" \"West\" \"West\" ...\n\n\nLet’s assign the summarized data frame to an object for inspection.\n\nDATA_SUM &lt;- \n  DATA |&gt;\n  group_by(School, District) |&gt;\n  summarize(Score = mean(Score))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'School'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nFor DATA_SUM, the structure is different. In particular, you see reference to (S3: grouped_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame). This tells you that the data frame is not a simple nxm but contains groups. You could think of this as 3 nxm data frames organized together. For more details, see the dplyr documentation.\n\nstr(DATA_SUM)\n\ngropd_df [5 × 3] (S3: grouped_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ School  : chr [1:5] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"D\" ...\n $ District: chr [1:5] \"West\" \"West\" \"East\" \"North\" ...\n $ Score   : num [1:5] 82.5 79.5 87 62.5 66\n - attr(*, \"groups\")= tibble [5 × 2] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n  ..$ School: chr [1:5] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\" \"D\" ...\n  ..$ .rows : list&lt;int&gt; [1:5] \n  .. ..$ : int 1\n  .. ..$ : int 2\n  .. ..$ : int 3\n  .. ..$ : int 4\n  .. ..$ : int 5\n  .. ..@ ptype: int(0) \n  ..- attr(*, \".drop\")= logi TRUE\n\n\n\ngroup_by() and summarize() with .groups\nWhen you group data using group_by() and then summarize(), the summary variables (e.g., mean) will result in a single row for each level of a single grouping variable. If there are more than one grouping variable, the additional grouping variable will be introduced to the data frame as a second column. The total number of rows in the data frame will be equal to the number of levels of group 1 x number of levels of group 2 if an only if each levels of group 1 has a corresponding level for group 2,\nfor example:\nsex   age    mean\nmen   young  x\nmen   old    x\nwomen young  x\nwomen old    x\nIf there is no pairing of levels in the data (e.g., no men who are old), that row will be omitted from the returned data frame.\nfor example:\nsex   age    mean\nmen   young  x\nwomen young  x\nwomen old    x\nrather than:\nsex   age    mean\nmen   young  x\nmen   old    NA\nwomen young  x\nwomen old    x\nYou really need to query ?dplyr::summarize to understand .groups, which controls the grouping of the returned data frame. This is also experimental to summarize(), so it might not be available in the future.\nParameters/Arguments:\nThere are four argument options:\n\n\"drop_last\": dropping the last level of grouping.

But with \"rowwise\" you will see this clearly. Following from above, let’s say we wanted to compute the mean across all of the Schools in the data frame returned by group_by() then summarize(). We add mutate(mean = mean(Score)) on a new line of our piped code block.\n\nDATA |&gt;\n  group_by(School, District) |&gt;\n  summarize(Score = mean(Score),\n            .groups = \"rowwise\"\n            ) |&gt;\n  mutate(mean = mean(Score))\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n# Rowwise:  School, District\n  School District Score  mean\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A      West      82.5  82.5\n2 B      West      79.5  79.5\n3 C      East      87    87  \n4 D      North     62.5  62.5\n5 E      North     66    66  \n\n\nThe mean column does not contain a single mean replicated for each row in the data frame. Rather the grouping was per row, so each row has its one mean. The mean of a single value is, of course, itself.\n\n\nRevisiting \".groups = drop_last\":\nReturning to the default .groups structure, which is \"drop_last\", we can add the same mutate() to see what happens.\n\nDATA |&gt;\n  group_by(School, District) |&gt;\n  summarize(Score = mean(Score),\n            .groups = \"drop_last\"\n            ) |&gt;\n  mutate(mean = mean(Score))\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n# Groups:   School [5]\n  School District Score  mean\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A      West      82.5  82.5\n2 B      West      79.5  79.5\n3 C      East      87    87  \n4 D      North     62.5  62.5\n5 E      North     66    66  \n\n\nThe mean column still has different values but they are replicated on rows with the same School group.

Functions do not work like you think they work. You must understand the function and check our work to ensure your calculations are what you intend them to be.\n\n\nThe order of operations matters\nTo illustrate further, consider you want to calculate some summary statistics. You set out to obtain the mean and the standard deviation for your data. Those computations will be performed according to the grouping structure.\nWhen you compute standard deviation and the mean of Score, you assign the mean to Score because you want your plot to contain a clean name rather than one like Score_Mean that you will have to address in the plot.\n\nDATA |&gt;\n  group_by(School, District) |&gt;\n  summarize(Score_sd = sd(Score),   # get sd \n            Score = mean(Score)     # get mean, assign to same name\n            ) \n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'School'.

The mean() is not based on some changed variable.\nThe output is different from the one returned when the mean is computed before the standard deviation and in particular when the mean is assigned to Score. In this case, the standard deviation is based on this new Score variable. Because the standard deviation is a measure of variability, and Score does not vary based on the grouping structure, NA is returned.\n\nDATA |&gt;\n  group_by(School, District) |&gt;\n  summarize(Score = mean(Score),   # get mean, assign to same name\n            Score_sd = sd(Score)   # get sd         \n            )\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'School'.

The function, however, does not require variables in a data frame in order to group based on their levels or differences in values.\n\ngroup_by() using a function\nHeretofore, we have grouped by column variables in a data frame. But you can also group in other ways, for example, by a variable calculated by a function. For example, if you wanted to group by standard deviations, you could calculated the standard deviation (Score-mean(Score)) / sd(Score) for each student and then cut() that variable into groups. cut will take a numeric vector variable and turn it into a factor variable of n groups as determined by what you pass to breaks. There is also an argument to make the factor ordered if you wish, ordered_result = TRUE but the default behavior does not order the factor. You can also change the level labels if you inspect the function.\n\nDATA |&gt;\n  group_by(z_factor = cut( \n    x = ((Score - mean(Score)) / sd(Score) ), \n    breaks = 5, \n    ordered_result = T\n    )\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 5\n# Groups:   z_factor [4]\n   Student      Score School District z_factor       \n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;ord&gt;          \n 1 Jim             80 A      West     (0.194,0.781]  \n 2 Sally           85 A      West     (0.781,1.37]   \n 3 June            79 B      West     (0.194,0.781]  \n 4 Mildred         80 B      West     (0.194,0.781]  \n 5 Tilford         81 C      East     (0.194,0.781]  \n 6 Beavis          91 C      East     (0.781,1.37]   \n 7 Herman          89 C      East     (0.781,1.37]   \n 8 Peppa           60 D      North    (-1.57,-0.979] \n 9 Kay             65 D      North    (-1.57,-0.979] \n10 Jake            67 E      North    (-0.979,-0.392]\n11 Name Missing    65 E      North    (-1.57,-0.979] \n\n\nYou can see that there are 4 different levels of the grouping variable.

For example, if we want levels to correspond to some meaningful standard-deviation cuts. For example, if you wanted to group those with z scores ranging from infinitely negative to -2, -2 to -1, - to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to infinitely large, you could specify the breaks.

OK, let’s plot it. Oh but first let me inspect the data. Um, why is School_Performance the same for all Students? Schools are not performing the same so they cannot all be average. Check your case_when() for errors because that where the new variable was created. Then you spend 40 days and 40 nights trying to fix your code. No matter what you do with case_when(), you cannot fix the problem. So you try to create 42 data frames to solve your problem. Even grandma knows that is a ridiculous strategy. She suggests you read the documentation for all of the functions you used because one time her pot-luck cake flopped and she inspected the expiration date for all of her ingredients and found the baking soda was old.\nYou discover that the grouping structure is retained on all operations until that grouping structure is removed or replaced."

Always create some documentation so that your future self and others know that the data actually represent.\nOnly the name variable is currently a column. We don’t have variables named year, weight, task, nor score. The measurement times of the repeated measurements (e.g., the numeric years) are currently stored as separate columns. The values of these columns represent the weights of individuals at two points in time. Some of this information would be unclear unless you had the documentation of what the variables were and how they were stored. This is why having good documentation, or requesting such documentation, is important.\nIn order to make the data tidy, we need to pivot the two year columns so that they are in arranged as a separate column containing. Take notice that stacking the two column vector would result in a vector that is twice as long. The result is a longer but narrower data frame. Other times, you may need to take a longer data frame and make it a shorter but wider data frame. The verb used to describe this type of transformation is pivot."

Options that are commented out are provided for demonstration. You can test them out if you wish.\n\nEXAMPLE |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = 2:3,            # by column position \n    # cols = c(2:3),       # by column position using c()\n    # cols = -1,           # by removing a position, or several -c(1, pos, pos)\n    # cols = !1,           # by NOT position\n    names_to = \"year\", \n    values_to = \"weight\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 7\n  name  task_A task_B  tsk1  tsk2 year  weight\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill      10     12    10    12 2023     175\n2 Bill      10     12    10    12 2024     170\n3 Sally     10     15    10    15 2023     120\n4 Sally     10     15    10    15 2024     135\n5 Jim       11     24    11    24 2023     150\n6 Jim       11     24    11    24 2024     150\n7 Sue       NA     NA    NA    NA 2023     115\n8 Sue       NA     NA    NA    NA 2024     120\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying characters\nVariables that contain certain characters can be selected for pivoting using functions from {tidyselect} like contains(), starts_with(), ends_with(), and matches(). We will now work through some examples. These functions load as part of {dplyr} as well.\n\nSpecifying characters using contains()\nIf we select column names that contains() the characters \"task\", we will select only the full spelling of the task; \"tsk\" columns will be skipped.\n\nEXAMPLE |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = contains(\"task\"),\n    names_to = \"task\", \n    values_to = \"score\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 7\n  name  `2023` `2024`  tsk1  tsk2 task   score\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill     175    170    10    12 task_A    10\n2 Bill     175    170    10    12 task_B    12\n3 Sally    120    135    10    15 task_A    10\n4 Sally    120    135    10    15 task_B    15\n5 Jim      150    150    11    24 task_A    11\n6 Jim      150    150    11    24 task_B    24\n7 Sue      115    120    NA    NA task_A    NA\n8 Sue      115    120    NA    NA task_B    NA\n\n\nWe can now see that there are two new column variables in the returned data frame: task and score.\nSome variables are not included in the pivot but nevertheless get included in the process. The task variables spelled differently and have a number suffix are replicated across rows but are not created as a new variable. Similarly, the weights for years are replicated across rows for each task but they are not addressed in the pivoting. Variable names are not perfect right now but they will be cleaned up better in examples of advanced pivoting.\nAs another example, we can select variables containing the underscore, \"_\". Because task_A and task_B are the only variables containing underscores, the outcome will be the same.\n\nEXAMPLE |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = contains(\"_\"),\n    names_to = \"task\", \n    values_to = \"score\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 7\n  name  `2023` `2024`  tsk1  tsk2 task   score\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill     175    170    10    12 task_A    10\n2 Bill     175    170    10    12 task_B    12\n3 Sally    120    135    10    15 task_A    10\n4 Sally    120    135    10    15 task_B    15\n5 Jim      150    150    11    24 task_A    11\n6 Jim      150    150    11    24 task_B    24\n7 Sue      115    120    NA    NA task_A    NA\n8 Sue      115    120    NA    NA task_B    NA\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying characters using starts_with()\nWe can also select variables for the pivot that start or end with certain characters. Notice that task_A, task_B, tsk_1, and tsk_2 all begin with the same letter. If we use that letter, the data frame will pivot on all 4 of those columns and use them to create a single column called task. Such an approach is very useful if the task variants represent different tasks. In this case, the letter and number suffix variables are redundant.\n\nEXAMPLE |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"t\"),\n    names_to = \"task\", \n    values_to = \"score\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 16 × 5\n   name  `2023` `2024` task   score\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Bill     175    170 task_A    10\n 2 Bill     175    170 task_B    12\n 3 Bill     175    170 tsk1      10\n 4 Bill     175    170 tsk2      12\n 5 Sally    120    135 task_A    10\n 6 Sally    120    135 task_B    15\n 7 Sally    120    135 tsk1      10\n 8 Sally    120    135 tsk2      15\n 9 Jim      150    150 task_A    11\n10 Jim      150    150 task_B    24\n11 Jim      150    150 tsk1      11\n12 Jim      150    150 tsk2      24\n13 Sue      115    120 task_A    NA\n14 Sue      115    120 task_B    NA\n15 Sue      115    120 tsk1      NA\n16 Sue      115    120 tsk2      NA\n\n\nThe logic for using ends_with() works the same way as starts_with(), so examples are not provided.\n\n\n\nSpecifying pattern matches\nThe matches() function is excellent for matching patterns by regular expression. When you cannot type literal characters for grabbing columns, you can think about patterns. We see for example that some variables end in letters and some end in numbers. We can certainly use ends_with() and specify the numbers to grab tsk1 and tsk2 but if there are numerous variables, doing so involves more work. Moreover, if you are dealing with data sets that can change from time to time, the numbers might change. Hard coding the numbers will create errors, for example, when your data frame no longer contains a variable named tsk1.\nIn such instances, matching patterns is a wonderful solution. Let’s use matches() to select columns that end in digits. The regular expression pattern \\\\d+ stands for one or more of any digit.\nSo what happens if we use cols = matches(\"\\\\d+\")?\n\nEXAMPLE |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = matches(\"\\\\d+\"),   # by looking for variables pattern of digits\n    names_to = \"task\", \n    values_to = \"score\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 16 × 5\n   name  task_A task_B task  score\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Bill      10     12 2023    175\n 2 Bill      10     12 2024    170\n 3 Bill      10     12 tsk1     10\n 4 Bill      10     12 tsk2     12\n 5 Sally     10     15 2023    120\n 6 Sally     10     15 2024    135\n 7 Sally     10     15 tsk1     10\n 8 Sally     10     15 tsk2     15\n 9 Jim       11     24 2023    150\n10 Jim       11     24 2024    150\n11 Jim       11     24 tsk1     11\n12 Jim       11     24 tsk2     24\n13 Sue       NA     NA 2023    115\n14 Sue       NA     NA 2024    120\n15 Sue       NA     NA tsk1     NA\n16 Sue       NA     NA tsk2     NA\n\n\nWell, that kind of worked but the year data that are also included in task because those variables also contained numbers matched by the pattern.\nSure, you could just remove the numbers from the data frame and pivot:\n\nEXAMPLE |&gt;\n  select(-c(2 ,3)) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = matches(\"\\\\d+\"),\n    names_to = \"task\", \n    values_to = \"score\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 5\n  name  task_A task_B task  score\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill      10     12 tsk1     10\n2 Bill      10     12 tsk2     12\n3 Sally     10     15 tsk1     10\n4 Sally     10     15 tsk2     15\n5 Jim       11     24 tsk1     11\n6 Jim       11     24 tsk2     24\n7 Sue       NA     NA tsk1     NA\n8 Sue       NA     NA tsk2     NA\n\n\nThe problem here is that the year data is removed. If you don’t need them, then that’s fine but if you do, you need a better solution. Moreover, sometimes you don’t know when you will need a variable so keeping them in the data set is likely a better solution. Let’s figure out how.\n\n\nSpecifying pattern matches\nWe see that the variables we want also begin with characters. We might decide to approach the problem by looking for matches to character patterns followed by digit patterns. The following two regular expressions will search for different patterns need to solve the problem.\n\n[a-zA-Z]+: match one or more characters\n\\\\d+: match one or more digits\n\nThe ordering of the patterns will find variable names that begin with characters followed by numbers.\nAn example matching letters and then digits:\n\nmatches(\"[a-zA-Z]+\\\\d+\")\n\nThis pattern would match variables that also contain special characters (e.g., \"_\", \"-\", \"&\", \"$\", etc.) between the letter and digits as well as characters after the numbers too. If your variables are more complex, you might need some additional patterns but for this example, the pattern should select what we want, which is to the tsk1 and tsk2 variables only.\n\nEXAMPLE |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = matches(\"[a-zA-Z]+\\\\d+\"),   # by looking for variables pattern of digits\n    names_to = \"task\", \n    values_to = \"score\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 7\n  name  `2023` `2024` task_A task_B task  score\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill     175    170     10     12 tsk1     10\n2 Bill     175    170     10     12 tsk2     12\n3 Sally    120    135     10     15 tsk1     10\n4 Sally    120    135     10     15 tsk2     15\n5 Jim      150    150     11     24 tsk1     11\n6 Jim      150    150     11     24 tsk2     24\n7 Sue      115    120     NA     NA tsk1     NA\n8 Sue      115    120     NA     NA tsk2     NA\n\n\nGreat! We now see that only tsk1 and tsk2 are selected for pivoting, and are dumped into a new variable named task and the values from them are placed in a new variable named score. Again, the values of task are messy but we will address dealing with that issue in advanced pivoting techniques.\n\n\nRegular Expression Anchors\nThere are special characters in for regular expressions that will achieve the same as starts_with() and ends_with().\n\n\nMatching Beginning Characters using the Caret ^\nTo see how ^ works, let’s add another variable that contains characters and then numbers but neither begins with characters nor ends to digits.\n\nEXAMPLE |&gt; \n  mutate(\"23abc24z\" = 1) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = matches(\"^[a-zA-Z]+\\\\d+\"),   \n    names_to = \"task\", \n    values_to = \"score\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 8\n  name  `2023` `2024` task_A task_B `23abc24z` task  score\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill     175    170     10     12          1 tsk1     10\n2 Bill     175    170     10     12          1 tsk2     12\n3 Sally    120    135     10     15          1 tsk1     10\n4 Sally    120    135     10     15          1 tsk2     15\n5 Jim      150    150     11     24          1 tsk1     11\n6 Jim      150    150     11     24          1 tsk2     24\n7 Sue      115    120     NA     NA          1 tsk1     NA\n8 Sue      115    120     NA     NA          1 tsk2     NA\n\n\nYou see that variable 23abc24z is not included in the pivot. As a result, the variable remains as a column in the data frame. However, it will be included if the matching is not constrained to starting with characters as seen here.\n\nEXAMPLE |&gt; \n  mutate(\"23abc24z\" = 1) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = matches(\"[a-zA-Z]+\\\\d+\"),   \n    names_to = \"task\", \n    values_to = \"score\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 7\n   name  `2023` `2024` task_A task_B task     score\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Bill     175    170     10     12 tsk1        10\n 2 Bill     175    170     10     12 tsk2        12\n 3 Bill     175    170     10     12 23abc24z     1\n 4 Sally    120    135     10     15 tsk1        10\n 5 Sally    120    135     10     15 tsk2        15\n 6 Sally    120    135     10     15 23abc24z     1\n 7 Jim      150    150     11     24 tsk1        11\n 8 Jim      150    150     11     24 tsk2        24\n 9 Jim      150    150     11     24 23abc24z     1\n10 Sue      115    120     NA     NA tsk1        NA\n11 Sue      115    120     NA     NA tsk2        NA\n12 Sue      115    120     NA     NA 23abc24z     1\n\n\n\n\nMatching Ending Characters using the dollar $\nTo test $ for ending patterns, let’s add the same variable.\n\nEXAMPLE |&gt; \n  mutate(\"23abc24z\" = 1) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = matches(\"[a-zA-Z]+\\\\d+$\"),   \n    names_to = \"task\", \n    values_to = \"score\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 8\n  name  `2023` `2024` task_A task_B `23abc24z` task  score\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill     175    170     10     12          1 tsk1     10\n2 Bill     175    170     10     12          1 tsk2     12\n3 Sally    120    135     10     15          1 tsk1     10\n4 Sally    120    135     10     15          1 tsk2     15\n5 Jim      150    150     11     24          1 tsk1     11\n6 Jim      150    150     11     24          1 tsk2     24\n7 Sue      115    120     NA     NA          1 tsk1     NA\n8 Sue      115    120     NA     NA          1 tsk2     NA\n\n\nAgain, you see that variable 23abc24z is not included in the pivot. But it will be included if the matching is not constrained to starting with characters as seen here.\n\nEXAMPLE |&gt; \n  mutate(\"23abc24z\" = 1) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = matches(\"[a-zA-Z]+\\\\d+\"),   \n    names_to = \"task\", \n    values_to = \"score\"\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 7\n   name  `2023` `2024` task_A task_B task     score\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Bill     175    170     10     12 tsk1        10\n 2 Bill     175    170     10     12 tsk2        12\n 3 Bill     175    170     10     12 23abc24z     1\n 4 Sally    120    135     10     15 tsk1        10\n 5 Sally    120    135     10     15 tsk2        15\n 6 Sally    120    135     10     15 23abc24z     1\n 7 Jim      150    150     11     24 tsk1        11\n 8 Jim      150    150     11     24 tsk2        24\n 9 Jim      150    150     11     24 23abc24z     1\n10 Sue      115    120     NA     NA tsk1        NA\n11 Sue      115    120     NA     NA tsk2        NA\n12 Sue      115    120     NA     NA 23abc24z     1\n\n\n\n\nMatching Beginning and Ending Characters\nUsing the two anchors together ^...$ is useful to test whether or not a string fully matches the pattern.
