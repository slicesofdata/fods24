Cook\"\n#date: \"2023-12-21\"\ndate: \"21 December, 2023\"\n\nexecute:\n  #enabled: false\n  freeze: auto\n\n#order: 2 \n---\n\n\n\n# **Overview**\n\nFor this course, we will use the `R` programming language and the `RStudio` IDE for manipulating data and creating data visualizations.\n\n# **To Do**\n\n## **Tasks**\n\nThe first step is to install these pieces of software so that you can use them. \n\n-   Download and Install R\n-   Download and Install RStudio\n-   Configure RStudio\n\n## **Readings**\n\n- [Intro to R](https://psyteachr.github.io/ads-v2/01-intro.html)\n- [Working with RMarkdown](https://socviz.co/gettingstarted.html#work-in-plain-text-using-rmarkdown)\n\n\n# **Determine the version of your computer's operating system**\n\nYour version of operating system will dictate which version of R to download and install. Make note of your computer's operating system.\n\n***Windows*** systemsare easier and Windows 10 and 11 operating systems will both use the same R versions.\n\n***Macs*** are somewhat more complicated. The version depends on your cpu. Here is how you can determine:\n\n<https://www.howtogeek.com/706226/how-to-check-if-your-mac-is-using-an-intel-or-apple-silicon-processor/> .\n\nThere will be two cpu options, Intel 64-bit for macOS 10.13 or Apple silicon arm64 for macOS 11 and higher.\n\n**Cloud Options:**\n\nIf you do not have a laptop (let me know) or do not have 5GB of hard drive space available on your computer, you might consider a cloud version of the software. One is maintained by Posit (formerly RStudio) and the other is maintained by CMC.\n\n1. [Posit](https://posit.cloud/plans/free)  (25 free compute hours a month -- make time out)\n\n2. Remote Desktop Protocol (No limit on compute hours) (contact me if interested)\n\n\n# **Download R**\n\nOnce you know your processor, navigate to <https://cran.r-project.org/> and in the \"**Download and Install R**\" section, select your operating system. You can also select from below and follow the indented sections that follow.\n\n- [Download R for Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/) ([Debian](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian), [Fedora/Redhat](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/fedora), [Ubuntu)](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu)\n\n- [Download R for macOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)\n\n- [Download R for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/)\n\n\n***Windows*** users should select the **base** version of R and download version **4.3.2** **(no other version)** to your computer. If this version is not on the main page, go to the \"Other Builds\" section and select \"previous releases\" and download the correct version.\n\n***Mac*** users should download either **R-4.3.2.pkg** or **R-4.3.2x86_64.pkg** version depending on the cpu noted earlier. **Do not** download any version other than 4.3.2 and please do not update throughout the semester.\n\n\n\n# **Download RStudio**\n\nUse the urls below to download RStudio and save it to the same directory location on your computer as you saved R. \n\n***Windows 10/11***: <https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/windows/RStudio-2023.12.0-369.exe>\n\n***MacOS 12+:*** <https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/macos/RStudio-2023.12.0-369.dmg>\n\n***MacOS 10.15-11:*** <https://download1.rstudio.org/electron//RStudio-2023.06.2-561.dmg>\n\n***Linux:*** go to <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>\n\n*Note:* If you have a 32bit operating system, you will need to install an older version: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/older-versions/>\n\n\n# **Install R and RStudio on your Computer**\n\n## *Install R first and then install RStudio.*\n\nInstalling should be easy and you can accept all of the defaults although the desktop icons are not needed, especially for R because you will never need it; RStudio will find R for you. You can follow these videos for simple installing.\n\n*PC*: [How to Install R and R Studio on Windows 10/11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2sewGCA0y4)\n\n*Mac*: [Installing R and RStudio on a Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Tfgt5gtWQ)\n\n**Note:** If you leave the desktop icon for R, you can remove that later. You will never need it because RStudio will find R for you.\n\n## *Additional Step for Mac Users:*\n\n*Download and Install XQuartz*\n\nSome functions in R require an \"X11 Server\" and/or libraries associated with an X11 server. Apple does not provide this software with OS X anymore so unfortunately you have to do it on your own via a third-party application called XQuartz for **OS X 10.9 or later**.\n\nUse the url below to download the XQuartz file and save it to your computer. Follow the same install instructions as above for installing the XQuartz file.\n\n**For macOS 10.9 or later, download this XQuartz file and save it to your computer and install:** <https://github.com/XQuartz/XQuartz/releases/download/XQuartz-2.8.5/XQuartz-2.8.5.pkg>\n\n# **Verify that RStudio is communicating correctly with R**\n\n***Launch the RStudio application.***\n\nIf RStudio and R are communicating correctly, you should see an RStudio window open with the R console opened which should look similar to that shown below. Your R version should be listed at the top of the console (**4.3.2**).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/RStudio1.png){width=599}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# **Configure RStudio**\n\nA. Go to ***Tools -> Global Options*** under the ***General + Basic*** Tab\n\n**R Sessions -> R version:** There should be a path to the installed R version listed if you installed R before R Studio. You should not need to change this unless you have another version installed on your system. If you do have multiple versions, browse to version **4.3.2**. Do not update R or any libraries during this course.\n\nB. **Other options**: Check the other check boxes as indicated in the images below.\n\n**GENERAL (basic):**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/RStudio2.png){width=468}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**CODE (editing):**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/RStudio3.png){width=468}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**CODE (display):**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/RStudio4.png){width=468}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**CODE (saving):**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/RStudio5.png){width=468}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**CODE (completing):**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/RStudio6.png){width=468}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**CODE (diagnostics):**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/RStudio7.png){width=468}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**CONSOLE:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/RStudio8.png){width=468}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**APPEARANCE:**\n\nThis one of preference. You can try out different RStudio Themes and Editor Themes to see what you like. You will see that I use the *Merbivore* Editor Theme with *Lucida Console* font.\n\n**OTHERS:** We will address in class as appropriate.\n\n\n# **Install some packages**\n\nAfter you have set up the install, you should install different libraries that we will use a various times in the course. Rather than installing them manually, copy the code below, paste it into the RStudio Console window at the `>` prompt (see image), and then press enter.\n\n**Copy this code:**\n\n```\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slicesofdata/fods24/main/r/psyc166_libraries.R\")\n```\n\n**Paste code into your R console at the `>` prompt:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/RStudio1.png){width=599}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe install process will take quite some time especially depending on your computer so do this at a time you do not want to use your system. Take a break and do something else. \n\n",
