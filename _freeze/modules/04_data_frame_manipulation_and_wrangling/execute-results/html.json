If you find some part requiring some editing, please let me know so I can fix it for you.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n# **Overview**\n\nThis module demonstrates how to use **{dplyr}** to wrangle data frames. There is much that you can do with the library and this module focuses on selecting, filtering, and arranging data frames or tibbles. Helper functions from libraries like **{magrittr}**, **{stringr}**, and **{tidyselect}** are also used in conjunction with **{dplyr}**.\n\n## **Libraries** \n\n\n- **{here}**: 1.0.1: for path management\n- **{dplyr}** 1.1.2: for selecting, filtering, and mutating\n- **{magrittr}** 2.0.3: for code clarity and piping data frame objects\n- **{stringr}**: 1.5.0: for working with strings\n- **{tidyselect}**: 1.2.0: for selecting sets from strings\n\n## **External Functions**\n\nProvided in class:\n\n`view_html()`: for viewing data frames in html format, from `/r/my_functions.R`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsource(here::here(\"r\", \"my_functions.R\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## **Libraries**\n\nWe will work with a few different libraries for data manipulation. Let's load them into our work space using `library()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(stringr)\n```\n:::\n\n\nMake note of any warnings that appear when loading libraries. There are some libraries that contain functions with the same names. Be aware that the most recently loaded library function will take precedence. You can avoid confusion using `::` to call a function from a particular library (e.g., `libraryname::functionname()`).\n\n\n# **A Grammar for Data Wrangling** \n\nThe [**{dplyr}**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package presents a type of grammar for wrangling data ([Wickham *and* Francois 2014](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275646200_dplyr_A_Grammar_of_Data_Manipulation)). **{dplyr}** is part of the [**{tidyverse}**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem which loads using `library(tidyverse)`, or specifically using `library(dplyr)`. **{dplyr}** also imports functions from **{tidyselect}**, which is also part of the **{tidyverse}** ecosystem.\n\nThe functions from any `R` package can be called after loading the package library. One does not need to reference the package explicitly when calling a function but to avoid confusion, we will often reference the package/library and the function together (e.g., `package::function()`).\n\nWorking with data involves creating new column variables, removing or renaming column variables, removing or deleting row observations, sorting, and summarizing data (often by groups/factors). etc. Consequently, there are five main function verbs for working with data in a data frame: `select`, `filter`, `mutate`, `arange`, and `summarize`. Their corresponding functions are:\n\n- `select(dataframe, variables_to_select)`: subset by columns \n- `mutate(dataframe, variables_to_create)` and `dplyr::rename()`: add or modify existing columns\n- `filter(dataframe, rows_to_select)`: subset by rows\n- `arrange(dataframe, variable_to_sort_by)`: sort rows\n- `summarize(dataframe, procedures_for_summarizing)` in conjunction with `dplyr::group_by()`: aggregate the data in some way\n\n\n# **Some Common Ways for Selecting Variables Using `{dplyr}`**\n\nYou can reference variables by their names or by their column position in a data frame (e.g., 1, 25, etc.). \n\nUsing `select()`, you can select columns/variables from a data frame. The variables you select are retained and variables omitted that you don't select are omitted in the returned data frame. \n\nIf you are not piping a data frame from a previous object using either `|>` (now in base `R`) or  `%>%` (from **{magrittr}**), the first argument passed into `select()` will be the data frame. The second and subsequent arguments can be column variables you wish to select from the data frame. \n\n```\nselect(mydataframe, myvars)\n```\n\nIf piping a data frame with **{magrittr}**, `.` or `.data` will serve to reference the inherited data frame. This detail is not needed but adding it serves as a reminder that the data frame is the first argument of the function. \n\n```\ndataframe %>%\n   select(., myvars)\n```\n\nVariables can be passed by their column position.\n\n*Passing variables separately by name:*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUSArrests %>% \n  select(., 1, 3) %>% head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           Murder UrbanPop\nAlabama      13.2       58\nAlaska       10.0       48\nArizona       8.1       80\nArkansas      8.8       50\nCalifornia    9.0       91\nColorado      7.9       78\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nVariables can be passed separately without quotes or collectively as a character vector.\n\n*Passing variables separately by name:*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUSArrests %>% \n  select(., Murder, Assault) %>% head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n*Note:* passing variables by name does not work with `base R` manipulation, you need to pass the name as a string.\n\n\n*Passing variables separately as characters:*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUSArrests %>% \n  select(., \"Murder\", \"Assault\") %>% head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n*Passing a character vector (more like you would do in `base R`):*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUSArrests %>% \n  select(., c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\")) %>% head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Passing a numeric vector of column positions:*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUSArrests %>% \n  select(., c(1, 3)) %>% head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           Murder UrbanPop\nAlabama      13.2       58\nAlaska       10.0       48\nArizona       8.1       80\nArkansas      8.8       50\nCalifornia    9.0       91\nColorado      7.9       78\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Passing an object holding a character vector containing two elements:*\n\nFirst, creat the vector object:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkeep_vars <- c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen pass the vector into the function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUSArrests %>% \n  select(., keep_vars) %>% head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Using an external vector in selections was deprecated in tidyselect 1.1.0.\nℹ Please use `all_of()` or `any_of()` instead.\n  # Was:\n  data %>% select(keep_vars)\n\n  # Now:\n  data %>% select(all_of(keep_vars))\n\nSee <https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/faq-external-vector.html>.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## *Select Variables Starting with or Ending with Certain Characters*\n\nOne thing about **{dplyr}**, when you load the library, there are functions from other libraries that are imported along with **{dplyr}**'s own functions. These important functions are designed to work with each other, so the people who maintain the libraries have packaged them up nicely so you don't have to load separate libraries. \n\nMany of the functions are imported from the **{tidyselect}** library and these functions are what give you additional manipulation ability. Some imported functions are: `all_of()`, `any_of()`, `contains()`, `ends_with()`, `everything()`, `last_col()`, `matches()`, and `starts_with()`.\n\nWith functions like `starts_with()`, `contains()`, and `ends_with()`, you can select variables with character patterns in their names.\n\nRather that passing the names of the variables as the second argument (e.g., `c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\")`), you would pass the helper function, say `starts_with()`. Whatever `starts_with()` returns is what gets passed to `select()` as the variables. This is what is referred to as functional programming. Rather than coding specifically what to do, you with utilize the task of another function to passed its returned object as an argument to another function.  \n\nBut first, we need to see what these functions, like `starts_with()`, are doing. For more information, use `?starts_with`.\n\n`starts_with(match, ignore.case = TRUE, vars = NULL)`\n\nNotice the arguments we need to pass: \n\n- `match`: A character vector\n- `ignore.case`: If `TRUE`, the default, ignores case when matching names. This is most flexible.\n- `vars`: A character vector of variable names. If not supplied, the variables are taken from the current selection context (as established by functions like `select()` or `pivot_longer()`).\n\nLet's just try out `starts_with()` on its own. Let's set a required pattern `match = some character` and because `vars = NULL` by default, let's just set `vars = some character vector`. Note that `vars` is not the second argument, so you will want to name it in the function call. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstarts_with(match = \"a\", vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ninteger(0)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nReturns `integer(0)` which is speak for \"there is no match\". Hmm, OK. Let's try another character.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstarts_with(match = \"b\", vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOK, so now an integer is returned (yes, try `is.integer()` if you don't believe me). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nis.integer(starts_with(\"b\", vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nImportantly, the value refers to the element index/position in the `vars` vector. Because the third string `\"Bye\"` starts with `\"b\"`, that's what is returned. \n\nTry something else:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstarts_with(\"h\", vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow a vector with length = 2 is returned, representing both the first and the second elements start with \"h\". \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlength(starts_with(\"h\", vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSee, it's really a vector containing the element(s) of the `vars` vector matching the pattern. \n\nAnd yes, this the letter casing is ignored because the default `ignore.case = TRUE`. Set to `FALSE` if you want your match to be case sensitive.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstarts_with(\"h\", \n            vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\"), \n            ignore.case = F\n            )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ninteger(0)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOK, no matches.\n\nYou will typically use `starts_with()` along with other functions. When using `starts_with()` in the context of `select()`, the `vars` argument is essentially passing `vars = the names of the columns of the data frame passed to select()`.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nselect(mydataframe,\n    starts_with(match = \"my pattern\",\n                vars = \"var names of mydataframe\")\n                )\n```\n\nPassing the `data frame` into `select()` without piping it using `%>%`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nselect(USArrests, starts_with(\"m\")) %>% head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           Murder\nAlabama      13.2\nAlaska       10.0\nArizona       8.1\nArkansas      8.8\nCalifornia    9.0\nColorado      7.9\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPiping the `data frame` into `select()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUSArrests %>%\n  select(., starts_with(\"m\")) %>% head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           Murder\nAlabama      13.2\nAlaska       10.0\nArizona       8.1\nArkansas      8.8\nCalifornia    9.0\nColorado      7.9\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUSArrests %>%\n  select(., ends_with(\"t\")) %>% head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           Assault\nAlabama        236\nAlaska         263\nArizona        294\nArkansas       190\nCalifornia     276\nColorado       204\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## *Selecting and Selecting Out Variables By/Between Index*\n\nThere are many approaches for *selecting* or *selecting out* column variables. You can pass multiple arguments for each specification or you can pass a single vector that contains all specifications.  \n\n- `select(., 1,2)`: select first and second columns\n- `select(., c(1,2))`: select first and second columns\n- `select(., -c(1,2))`: select out first and second columns\n\n- `select(., 1:2)`: select first through second columns\n- `select(., c(1:2))`: select first through second columns\n- `select(., -c(1:2))`: select out first through second columns\n\n*Potential Recommendation*: use options utilizing `c()` to pass a vector because this habit will be more versatile with `base R` functionality. However, online solutions will likely not take this approach.\n\n\nLet's make a data frame to work with first.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT <- data.frame(\n  Id  = c(100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 100, 105),\n  Sex = c('male', 'female', 'Male', NA, 'man', \"male\", \"neither\"),\n  Age = c(25, 33, 27, 40, 44, 25, 40),\n  Renting = c(\"yes\", NA, \"yes\", NA, \"no\", \"yes\", \"yes\")\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSelect columns 1 and 2: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>%\n  select(., 1,2) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id     Sex\n1 100    male\n2 101  female\n3 102    Male\n4 103    <NA>\n5 104     man\n6 100    male\n7 105 neither\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSelect columns 1 and 2 as a vector containing values 1 and 2:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>%\n  select(., c(1,2)) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id     Sex\n1 100    male\n2 101  female\n3 102    Male\n4 103    <NA>\n5 104     man\n6 100    male\n7 105 neither\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSelect out columns 1 and 2 as a vector containing values 1 and 2:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>%\n  select(., -c(1,2)) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Age Renting\n1  25     yes\n2  33    <NA>\n3  27     yes\n4  40    <NA>\n5  44      no\n6  25     yes\n7  40     yes\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSelect from columns 1 to 2 using the `:` operator:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>%\n  select(., 1:2) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id     Sex\n1 100    male\n2 101  female\n3 102    Male\n4 103    <NA>\n5 104     man\n6 100    male\n7 105 neither\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSelect from columns 1 through 3 using a vector containing the `:` operator:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>%\n  select(., c(1:3)) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id     Sex Age\n1 100    male  25\n2 101  female  33\n3 102    Male  27\n4 103    <NA>  40\n5 104     man  44\n6 100    male  25\n7 105 neither  40\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSelect out columns 1 through 3 using a vector containing the `:` operator:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>%\n  select(., -c(1:3))   # select out from here to there\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Renting\n1     yes\n2    <NA>\n3     yes\n4    <NA>\n5      no\n6     yes\n7     yes\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## *Selecting and Selecting Out Variables By or Between Character Name*\n\nThese approaches are similar to those offered earlier except that some involve passing variables by their name (e.g., character names). Whereas the order of the variables in a data frame may move around, the names may be more stable or permanent, at least after you have cleaned up the names. Consequently, passing variables by name may be more foolproof. \n\nYou don't have to be familiar with all approaches and you may settle on using one that makes the most sense to you.\n\n- `select(., \"var1\", \"var2\")`\n- `select(., c(\"var1\", \"var2\"))`\n- `select(., -c(\"var1\", \"var2\"))`\n\n- `select(., var1:var2))`\n- `select(., c(\"var1\":\"var2))`\n- `select(., -c(\"var1\":\"var2))`\n\n*Recommendation*: use options utilizing `c()` as this will be more versatile with `base R` functionality.\n\nThese approaches also work but they may lead to some confusion regarding usage of quotes:\n\n- `select(., var1, var2)`\n- `select(., c(var1, var2))`\n- `select(., -c(var1, var2))` \n\n\nSelect variables `Id` though `Age` using the `:` operator:\n\n\n:::

You will have missing rows, incorrect variable names, files with columns named the same, `NA`s, strings for numbers, duplicate rows of data, people who completed a survey twice, and all sorts of unimaginable and unbelievable data problems. So cleaning is important. \n\nWhereas `select()` is used for columns, `filter()` operates on rows. Data frame manipulation may involve keeping only certain rows for data, for example, male or female respondents, male respondents, those who do not contain missing values (e.g., `NA`s) for a specific column variable, who are of a certain age (or born in in certain year), who are above (or below) some acceptable criterion, etc. \n\nWhen a column variable has more than one value (e.g., check using `unique()` to determine the unique elements contained), you may wish to filter on some but not others. \n\nYou may even need to filter rows in a data frame that are distinct (e.g., not duplicate responses). This is often a good first step in order to determine the size of the usable data set. `dplyr::distinct()` makes de-duplicating easy as this function will return only distinct rows.\n\n\n## *Removing duplicate rows using `distinct()`*\n\n- `dplyr::distinct()`: remove duplicate rows\n- `dplyr::distinct(., column)`: remove duplicate rows by column\n- `na.omit()`: remove any row with NA’s (missing values)\n\nLet's use the simple `DAT` data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT # or with %>% print() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id     Sex Age Renting\n1 100    male  25     yes\n2 101  female  33    <NA>\n3 102    Male  27     yes\n4 103    <NA>  40    <NA>\n5 104     man  44      no\n6 100    male  25     yes\n7 105 neither  40     yes\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice that rows 1 and 6 are the same person (e.g., Id) and have exactly the same data for all variables. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT[1,] == DAT[6,]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    Id  Sex  Age Renting\n1 TRUE TRUE TRUE    TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat that the rows are consistent but you don't want their data twice. So let's just remove any rows that are identical.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>%\n  distinct(.) #%>%    # Remove exact duplicates\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id     Sex Age Renting\n1 100    male  25     yes\n2 101  female  33    <NA>\n3 102    Male  27     yes\n4 103    <NA>  40    <NA>\n5 104     man  44      no\n6 105 neither  40     yes\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you know each row is unique based on a variable in the data frame, you can also use `distinct()` to remove duplicates for a specific variable. Make sure that this variable specification is actually one that you would not want duplicates of.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>%             \n  distinct(., Id) # %>% view_html(.) # Remove duplicates by variable; passes unique values for data frame\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id\n1 100\n2 101\n3 102\n4 103\n5 104\n6 105\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut this function simply returns the unique values in `Id`. To retain the variables, set `.keep_all = T`. If you want to remove duplicates and assign the cleaned data frame to an object, you would likely want to keep all of your variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>%             \n  distinct(., Id, .keep_all = T) #%>% view_html(.)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id     Sex Age Renting\n1 100    male  25     yes\n2 101  female  33    <NA>\n3 102    Male  27     yes\n4 103    <NA>  40    <NA>\n5 104     man  44      no\n6 105 neither  40     yes\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice, however, this only removed the last instance or `Id == 100`. Which row to include is a judgment call. The first, the last, neither, the average? Is there a correct answer? \n\n\n# **Filtering using {dplyr} and Understanding Filtering Operators**\n\nFiltering cases using the `dplyr::filter()` verbs works by removing rows that do not match a specific criterion and then by returning the data frame that omits the mismatched condition. \n\nSome useful filtering operators and functions include: `==`, `>`, `>=`, `&`, `|`, `!`, `xor()`, `c()`, `is.na()`, `between()`, `near()`. \n\nRow/Observations/Cases can be filtered to \"include\" only certain matched conditions or can be filtered to \"exclude\" by negating those matched conditions. If the column variable `Sex` is in the data frame and cases are `'male'`, `'men'`, `'female'`, `'women'`, `'neither'`, `NA`, etc., you can specify the column `Sex` variable and then the row matching condition(s). \n\nThe first argument in `dplyr::filter()` is a data frame, and the function all `dplyr::filter(DAT, Sex == 'female')` will filter the data frame named `DAT` to include rows for which the `sex` column equals `'female'`. In other words, `TRUE` rows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndplyr::filter(DAT, Sex == 'female')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id    Sex Age Renting\n1 101 female  33    <NA>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSimilarly, the function call `dplyr::filter(., Sex == 'male')` can be read \"filter the data frame to include rows for which the value of `Sex == 'male'` is `TRUE`\". \n\nMore flexibly, however, you could specify a vector containing acceptable strings using `c()`. `dplyr::filter(., Sex %in% c('male'))` filters the rows to include only those for which the value for `sex` is in the string vector which includes a single string,`'male'` whereas `dplyr::filter(., Sex %in% c('male', 'Man'))` filters the rows to include only those for which the value for `Sex` is in the string vector which includes `'male'` and `'Man'`. Cases containing `'Male'`, `'Men'` (R is a case-sensitive language), or `'female'`, for example, will not be included in the returned data frame because they do not match values in the string vector. \n\n\n# **Piping Multiple Filter Function Calls**\n\nIn many cases, data filtering will involve different conditions for different column variables, so specifying them separately as separate lines of code is most appropriate. \n\nWhen passing a data frame using `%>%` from **{magrittr}**, the first argument for the data frame can be specified using a `.` because the function inherits the data frame manipulated.

For matching characters in levels of variables, you'll need something like `stringr::str_detect()` or `grepl()`. \n\n- `stringr::str_detect()`: returns matching conditions\n\nThe example below uses `str_detect()` to detect the presence of a character match and returns a logic vector with `TRUE`s for matching cases. When paired with `filter()`, the data frame is filtered by to contains cases that match the pattern for the variable.\n\nExample: `stringr::str_detect(my_variable, \"pattern\")`: \n\nLet's look for levels of `Sex` for which `\"ma\"` is detected.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>% dplyr::filter(., stringr::str_detect(Sex, \"ma\")) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id    Sex Age Renting\n1 100   male  25     yes\n2 101 female  33    <NA>\n3 104    man  44      no\n4 100   male  25     yes\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut the case for which `Sex = Male` is now missing. This is because `stringr::str_detect()` is a case-sensitive pattern match. \n\nYou can fix this is a couple ways:\n\n1) make the cases in `Sex` all lower case to `mutate()` the fix or\n2) to wrap `Sex` in `tolower()` to make cases lowercase. \n\nThe first option might be better if you want to fix the problem in the data frame. \n\nOther casing functions are:\n\n- `tolower()`: returns lower case of string\n- `toupper()`: returns upper case of string\n- `tools::toTitleCase()`: returns Title Case (capitalize first letter of string) \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>%\n  filter(., stringr::str_detect(tolower(Sex), \"ma\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id    Sex Age Renting\n1 100   male  25     yes\n2 101 female  33    <NA>\n3 102   Male  27     yes\n4 104    man  44      no\n5 100   male  25     yes\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor some, reading this code may be difficult. In order to understand the code, you need to read it inside out like slices of an onion. First understand the first function as the returned value is passed to the next function and so forth. \n\nFor example, elements of the `Sex` vector are converted to lower case and returned using `tolower()`. We can demonstrate this using only the vector from the data frame using the `$` operator, `DAT$Sex`.\n\nThe initial vector:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT$Sex\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"male\"    \"female\"  \"Male\"    NA        \"man\"     \"male\"    \"neither\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo lowercase:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntolower(DAT$Sex)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"male\"    \"female\"  \"male\"    NA        \"man\"     \"male\"    \"neither\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, `stringr::str_detect()` will return a vector of `TRUE` or `FALSE` for all element positions of `DAT$Sex` for which the (now lowercase) string matches `\"ma\"`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstringr::str_detect(tolower(DAT$Sex), \"ma\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE    NA  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother approach would be to perform the steps in pieces by first mutating the data frame so that elements in the `Sex` vector are converted to lowercase and then pipe that mutated data from to `filter()`.  \n\nBriefly, we will introduce `dplyr::mutate()` to accomplish this goal. `mutate()` is used to add, update, etc. variables in a data frame or tibble.\n\nMutate `Sex` using `mutate()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>%\n  mutate(., Sex = tolower(Sex))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id     Sex Age Renting\n1 100    male  25     yes\n2 101  female  33    <NA>\n3 102    male  27     yes\n4 103    <NA>  40    <NA>\n5 104     man  44      no\n6 100    male  25     yes\n7 105 neither  40     yes\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow mutate and pipe that mutated data frame using `%>%` (from **{margittr}**) or `|>` (`base R` version 4.1+) to `filter()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>%\n  mutate(., Sex = tolower(Sex)) %>%\n  filter(., stringr::str_detect(Sex, \"ma\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id    Sex Age Renting\n1 100   male  25     yes\n2 101 female  33    <NA>\n3 102   male  27     yes\n4 104    man  44      no\n5 100   male  25     yes\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nPairing this piping approach with `toTitleCase()` may be better as only the first letter will be capitalized and you are looking for \"Ma\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDAT %>%\n  mutate(., Sex = tools::toTitleCase(Sex)) %>%\n  filter(., stringr::str_detect(Sex, \"Ma\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   Id  Sex Age Renting\n1 100 Male  25     yes\n2 102 Male  27     yes\n3 104  Man  44      no\n4 100 Male  25     yes\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut notice the `male` and `man` issue is still a problem. \n\nSo what are the unique elements in `DAT$Sex`?
