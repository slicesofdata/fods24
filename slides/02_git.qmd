## **Version Control**

::: {.incremental}
* What is version control? 
  * Project backup
  * See specific changes inside files
  * Undo changes (time machine)
  
* [Version Control Summary Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-O8ZNW9icQ)
:::


## **Version Control: Git Workflow Basics**

There are three main parts to Git Workflow:

::: {.incremental}
- Version control for files (not empty directories)
- Make local changes (in your working directory) 
- **Stage** changes (in your staging directory) 
- **Commit** changes (to apply them for pushing to your remote repository)
- [Version Control Workflow Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8PGuOyZ3YU)
* Other Parts 
  * **Push** for sending commits to GitHub 
  * **Merge** for merging branches (i.e., to incorporate your edits into main)
:::


## **Git: Image Version**

[understanding git through images](https://dev.to/nopenoshishi/understanding-git-through-images-4an1)


## **Connecting Git to GitHub: The RStudio Terminal**

::: {.incremental}
- **Configure** Git and GitHub in RStudio Terminal
- **Create** token
- **Set** token
- Can use the RStudio Gui (clunky though)
:::


## **Configuring Git and GitHub with {usethis}**

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "janegit", 
                        user.email = "jane_git@gitrdone.com"
                        )
```


## **Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT) for GitHub with {usethis}**

::: {.incremental} 
- `usethis::create_github_token()`
- Create token and **copy to your clipboard**
:::

## **Setting your Git Credentials (using PAT) with {gitcreds}**

::: {.incremental}
- `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`
- Choose option to either *set* or *replace* 
- At `? Enter new password or token`, **paste** PAT to set
- `gh::gh_whoami()` to check if set
:::

## **Making Local File Changes, Committing, and Pushing to GitHub**

::: {.incremental}
- Make a change to a file
- Check **status** of project for changes
- **Stage** change
- **Commit** all changes
- **Push** changes
- **Commit** a specific change
- **Pull** changes down from repo (downloads and integrates changes)
- **Fetch** downloads new data (does not change your working copy)
:::


## **Checking the Status of Local File Changes**

At the **Terminal** in RStudio

- `$ git status`


## **Shared Repository Workflow**

* update your local repo
  * `git pull origin master`
* ensure you are on main branch
  * `git checkout 
* create a working branch
  * `git checkout -b yourBranchName`
* make your changes on your branch and stage them 
  * `git add`
* commit changes locally
  * `git commit -m "description of changes"`
* upload the changes (including your new branch) to GitHub 
  * `git push origin yourBranchName`

* Visit main repo on GitHub where you should now see your new branch
click on your branch name
click on “Pull Request” button (URC)
click on “Send Pull Request”

## **Some Basic Commands**

BASIC COMMANDS/ACTIONS
Term	Explanation
* `Fork`: to make a copy of a repo in your own GitHub account
* `Clone`: make a copy of the your GitHub repo on your local computer. 
  * In CLI: ‘git clone’ copies a remote repo to create a local repo with a remote called origin automatically set up.
`Pull`:	incorporate changes into your repo
`Add`:	Adding snapshots of your changes to the "Staging" area.
`Commit`:	akes the files as they are in your staging area and stores a snap shot of your files (changes) permanently in your Git directory.
`Push`:	You "push" your files (changes) to the remote repo
`Merge`: Incorporate changes into the branch you are on.
`Pull Request`: Term used in collaboration. By "issuing a pull request" to the owner of the upstream repo, you are requesting that your changes be pulled into their repo (accept your changes/work).



## **The Process in Library Form**

* check out original (checkout main)
* make a copy of the original (checkout <branch>)
* make edits to the copy
* add the edits (add)
* commit to those changes (commit)
* push the edits to the copy (push) - optional 
* switch/check out the original (checkout main)
* merge edits to the original (merge)


## **Main Branch, Your Branch, Merging Your Branch to Main**

1. Switch to the main branch:
   * `git checkout main`

2. Merge the branch into main:
   * `git merge <branch>`

3. Confirm 

4. Delete the branch:
   * `git branch -d <branch>`

5. Confirm branch removal:

   * `git branch`

6. Repeat with new issue
  * Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5



## **Staging Changes (Adding Changes)**

::: {.incremental}
* [Staging and Committing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7exFDGHgQcw)
  * Untracked vs. tracked files 
  * To have tracked by Git, you need to **add**
:::

## **Staging a *Specific* Change**

::: {.incremental}
* `$ git add <file>...` such that `<file>` refers to the file name

* file might be in a directory, e.g., `r/`

* `$ git add r/yourname.R`

* Tab to auto-complete, e.g., `git add r/you{TAB}`
:::


## **Staging *All* Changes**


* `$ git add .`


## **Committing the Change(s)** 

::: {.incremental}
-  `git commit` is used to commit the changes
- add `-m` to tell git you want a message (e.g., `"my message here"`)  
- `$ git commit -m "added my first .R file"`
:::

## **Push (publish) the change(s) from your branch to the remote repository**

::: {.incremental}
- `$ git push`

- [Pushing changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqw7ipXmc-4)
:::

## **Pulls change(s) from the remote repository**

::: {.incremental}
- `$ git pull`
- If you make changes that other will need, let them know to pull
:::

## **Fetch changes**
