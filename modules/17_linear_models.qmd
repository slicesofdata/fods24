# **Overview**

In this module, we will introduce using `R` to model data using familiar linear models (e.g., OLS linear regression). The module will not formally address what a linear model is and why one would use one as such topics have been covered in prerequisite statistics courses.  



## **Readings and Preparation**

*Before Class*: First, read to familiarize yourself with the concepts rather than master them. I will assume that you attend class with some level of basic understanding of concepts and working of functions. The goal of reading should be to understand and implement code functions as well as support your understanding and help your troubleshooting of problems. This cannot happen if you just read the content without interacting with it, however reading is absolutely essential to being successful during class time. Work through some examples so that you have a good idea of your level of understanding and confidence. 

*Class*: In class, some functions and concepts will be introduced and we will practice implementing code through exercises.
